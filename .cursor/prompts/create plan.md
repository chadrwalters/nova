    <task>
        1. Run cursor-tools plan "Create a plan to implement design.md and if we have it for the prd.md."
        1. Read the content from `local-research/initialplan.md`.
        2. Create a structured plan with two main sections:
            - Status/Project Tracking Section: Organize tasks into phases and subtasks, using checkboxes to indicate completion status.
            - Detailed Task Descriptions: Provide detailed information for each subtask, clearly demarked by numbers.
        3. Save the refined plan in `local-research/plan.md`.
