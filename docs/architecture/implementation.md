# Nova Implementation Details

## Overview

Nova is a personal knowledge management system that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide intelligent access to your notes and documents. It supports multiple LLM providers through a flexible abstraction layer, with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo as the default model.

## Architecture

The system is composed of several key components:

1. Document Processing Pipeline
2. Embedding Generation
3. Vector Store
4. RAG Orchestrator
5. LLM Integration
6. Security Layer

### LLM Integration

Nova supports multiple LLM providers through an abstract base class `LLMClient`. This allows for easy switching between providers and addition of new ones. The system includes:

- Default provider: OpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k)
- Alternative provider: Anthropic Claude
- Factory pattern for client creation
- Consistent response type across providers
- Streaming support for real-time responses

Key interfaces:

```python
class LLMClient(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def complete(
        self, 
        payload: MCPPayload,
        stream: bool = False,
        **kwargs
    ) -> Union[LLMResponse, AsyncGenerator[str, None]]:
        """Complete a prompt with the LLM."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def _format_payload(self, payload: MCPPayload) -> dict:
        """Format the MCP payload for the specific LLM."""
        pass
```

Configuration example:

```yaml
# Default (OpenAI)
llm:
  provider: "openai"
  api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"
  max_tokens: 1000
  temperature: 0.7

# Alternative (Claude)
llm:
  provider: "claude"
  api_key: "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"
  model: "claude-2"
  max_tokens: 1000
  temperature: 0.7
```

Provider selection is based on:
- Cost considerations (OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-16k is most cost-effective)
- Context window requirements
- Response speed needs
- API reliability

### RAG Orchestrator

The RAG Orchestrator coordinates the retrieval and generation process:

1. Processes incoming queries
2. Retrieves relevant context from the vector store
3. Constructs MCP payloads
4. Interacts with the selected LLM provider
5. Returns responses (streaming or complete)

Key components:

```python
class RAGOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, config: Config, llm_client: LLMClient):
        self.config = config
        self.llm_client = llm_client
        self.vector_store = VectorStore(config)
    
    async def process_query(
        self,
        query: str,
        stream: bool = False
    ) -> Union[str, AsyncGenerator[str, None]]:
        context = await self._get_context(query)
        payload = self._build_payload(query, context)
        return await self.llm_client.complete(payload, stream=stream)
```

### Document Processing

The document processing pipeline handles:

1. File format conversion (via Docling)
2. Text extraction and cleaning
3. Semantic chunking
4. Metadata preservation

### Embedding Generation

Embeddings are generated using:

- Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Dimension: 384
- Batch processing for efficiency

### Vector Store

The vector store uses FAISS for:

- Efficient similarity search
- In-memory index
- Fast retrieval

### Security

Security measures include:

- API key management
- Ephemeral data handling
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

## Performance Considerations

- OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-16k provides optimal cost/performance ratio
- Efficient context retrieval through FAISS
- Streaming responses for better UX
- Batched operations where possible

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:

- API errors (rate limits, authentication)
- Resource constraints
- Invalid inputs
- Network issues

## Monitoring

Includes monitoring for:

- Query latency
- Token usage
- Error rates
- Memory usage
- Vector store size

## Future Considerations

1. Additional LLM providers
2. Enhanced caching strategies
3. Distributed vector store
4. Advanced query optimization
5. Multi-user support
