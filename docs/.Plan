## Notes
- Each milestone includes a full testing checkpoint
- Progress updates will be made after each milestone
- Risk register to be updated as new risks are identified
- Milestones ordered by importance:
  1. Document Processing (core functionality) [DONE]
  2. Content Organization (essential for output) [DONE]
  3. Core Infrastructure (supports everything) [IN PROGRESS]
  4. Advanced Handlers (additional features)
  5. Finalization & Polish (optimization)
- Current focus: Core Infrastructure completion
- Added DisassemblyPhase for better content organization:
  - Separates content splitting from aggregation
  - Improves attachment handling
  - Maintains clean directory structure
- Split phase improvements:
  - Works with pre-split content
