## Risk Register
1. Document processing reliability
2. Content organization complexity
3. Memory usage with large documents
4. OpenAI API integration complexity
5. Cross-platform compatibility
6. Performance with large datasets

## Technical Decisions Log
- Date: 2024-01-18 - Initial plan created
- Date: 2024-01-18 - Reordered milestones by importance, prioritizing core document processing

## Progress Log
- 2024-01-18: Plan created and reorganized by importance

## Next Actions
1. Begin document handler implementation
2. Create base handler interface
3. Implement basic text extraction

## Notes
- Each milestone includes a full testing checkpoint
- Progress updates will be made after each milestone
- Risk register to be updated as new risks are identified
- Milestones ordered by importance:
  1. Document Processing (core functionality)
  2. Content Organization (essential for output)
  3. Core Infrastructure (supports everything)
  4. Advanced Handlers (additional features)
  5. Finalization & Polish (optimization)
