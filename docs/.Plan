# Nova Enhanced Linking Implementation Plan

## Context & Goals

This plan outlines the implementation of an enhanced linking system for Nova's document processing pipeline. The goal is to improve navigation and traceability between Summary.md, Raw Notes.md, and Attachments.md by implementing explicit bi-directional linking and context preservation.

Current State:
- Basic linking through _update_links method
- Focus on attachment references
- No explicit bi-directional linking
- Limited context preservation

Target State:
- Explicit bi-directional linking between all document types
- Context preservation in links
- Standardized section anchors
- Metadata-driven link automation
- Rich context tooltips

## Risk Register

[ACTIVE] - Link integrity during file moves/renames
[ACTIVE] - Performance impact of additional link processing
[ACTIVE] - Backward compatibility with existing content
[ACTIVE] - Circular reference handling
[ACTIVE] - Link validation complexity

## Initial Setup
[STATUS: NOT_STARTED] [PROGRESS: 0%]

1. Branch Creation and Setup
   - [ ] Create feature/enhanced-linking branch from main
   - [ ] Verify clean working directory

   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

3. Error Handling & Recovery
   - [ ] Implement link repair strategies
   - [ ] Add fallback handling for broken links
   - [ ] Create link validation reporting
   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

### Phase 3: UI/UX Implementation
[STATUS: NOT_STARTED] [PROGRESS: 0%]

1. Navigation Enhancement
   - [ ] Add navigation headers to all documents
   - [ ] Implement quick navigation shortcuts
   - [ ] Add context tooltips
   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

2. Link Visualization
   - [ ] Add relationship indicators
   - [ ] Implement context previews
   - [ ] Create navigation breadcrumbs
   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests
   - [ ] Link generation tests
   - [ ] Validation logic tests
   - [ ] Metadata integration tests
   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

2. Integration Tests
   - [ ] End-to-end link processing tests
   - [ ] Cross-document linking tests
   - [ ] Performance impact tests
   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

3. Migration Tests
   - [ ] Backward compatibility tests
   - [ ] Content migration tests
   - [ ] Link repair tests
   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

## Documentation Updates

1. Architecture Documentation
   - [ ] Update linking system documentation
   - [ ] Add new metadata documentation
   - [ ] Document link validation system
   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

2. User Documentation
   - [ ] Update user guide with new linking features
   - [ ] Add link management documentation
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
   Status: NOT_STARTED
   Notes: None

## Plan Management Rules

1. Status Updates
   - After each task completion, update status and progress
   - Add any important notes or findings
   - Update risk register if new risks identified
   - Document any technical decisions made

2. Handover Notes
   - Keep notes clear and detailed for potential handover
   - Document any workarounds or temporary solutions
   - Maintain clear status of current task
   - List any pending decisions or blockers

3. Branch Management
   - Work to be done on feature/enhanced-linking branch
   - Regular commits with clear messages
   - Update plan file with each significant change

## Current Status

Overall Progress: 0%
Current Phase: Planning
Active Tasks: None
Last Updated: [DATE]
Next Steps: Create feature branch and begin Phase 1

## Notes

Important: After completing each task:
1. Update this plan with status and progress
2. Add any important findings or decisions
3. Document any challenges or solutions
4. Update risk register if needed
5. Note any impact on future tasks
