# Nova Document Processor Pipeline Rules

- All work must be guided by the .Plan file in docs/.Plan
- LLM must check .Plan at the start of each interaction
- After each step, LLM must update .Plan with:
  - Progress status
  - Completion timestamps
  - New findings or dependencies
  - Updated risk register
  - Next action items
- Plan updates must maintain:
  - Clear status markers [TODO/IN_PROGRESS/DONE]
  - Precise progress percentage
  - Chronological log of completed items
  - Updated technical decisions
  - Current phase tracking
- Before starting new work:
  - Verify current phase in .Plan
  - Check dependencies are met
  - Confirm next action items
  - Update implementation status
- After completing work:
  - Mark tasks as complete
  - Add completion timestamp
  - Document any issues encountered
  - Update next actions
  - Recalculate progress percentage
