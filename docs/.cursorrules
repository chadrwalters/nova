# Nova Document Processor Pipeline Rules

## Plan Management
- All work must be guided by the .Plan file in docs/.Plan
- LLM must check .Plan at the start of each interaction
- After each step, LLM must update .Plan with:
  - Progress status
  - Completion timestamps
  - New findings or dependencies
  - Updated risk register
  - Next action items

## Plan Updates
- Plan updates must maintain:
  - Clear status markers [TODO/IN_PROGRESS/DONE]
  - Precise progress percentage
  - Chronological log of completed items
  - Updated technical decisions
  - Current phase tracking

## Before New Work
- Before starting new work:
  - Verify current phase in .Plan
  - Check dependencies are met
  - Confirm next action items
  - Update implementation status

## Milestone Completion Requirements
- At the end of EVERY milestone:
  1. Run and fix ALL tests until they pass
  2. Execute cleanup.sh -a && run_nova.sh
  3. Review console output for errors/warnings
  4. Examine output files for correctness:
     - Check file structure
     - Verify content formatting
     - Validate links and references
     - Ensure metadata is correct
  5. Document any issues found
  6. Fix ALL issues before moving to next milestone
  7. Update .Plan with milestone completion

## After Work Completion
- After completing work:
  - Mark tasks as complete
  - Add completion timestamp
  - Document any issues encountered
  - Update next actions
  - Recalculate progress percentage
  - Verify milestone requirements if applicable
