# Nova System Monitoring

## Overview

The Nova system includes comprehensive monitoring capabilities for tracking system health, performance, and resource usage. This document outlines the monitoring features and their usage.

## Components

### Health Monitoring

The health monitoring system provides real-time status of system components:

```bash
nova monitor health
```

This command displays:
- Memory status (healthy/warning/critical)
- Vector store health
- Monitor service status
- Log system status
- Session uptime

### Statistics Tracking

System statistics can be viewed using:

```bash
nova monitor stats
```

This provides:
- Memory usage metrics
  - Current memory usage
  - Peak memory usage
  - Warning count
- Session information
  - Start time
  - Uptime
- Component-specific metrics
  - Vector store statistics
  - Monitor statistics
  - Log system metrics

### Performance Profiling

Performance profiling features help identify bottlenecks:

```bash
# Start a new profile
nova monitor profile --name my_profile

# List available profiles
nova monitor profiles
```

Profile data includes:
- CPU usage
- Memory allocation
- I/O operations
- Duration metrics
- Profile files location

### Log Management

View system logs with:

```bash
nova monitor logs
```

Features:
- Real-time log viewing
- Log level filtering (ERROR/WARNING/INFO)
- Component-based filtering
- Automatic log rotation
- Log archival

## Type Definitions

The monitoring system uses TypeScript-like type definitions for data structures:

```python
class MemoryStatus(TypedDict):
    status: str  # "healthy" | "warning" | "critical"

class HealthStatus(TypedDict):
    memory: MemoryStatus
    vector_store: str
    monitor: str
    logs: str
    session_uptime: float
    status: str

class ProcessStats(TypedDict):
    current_memory_mb: float
    peak_memory_mb: float
    warning_count: int

class SystemStats(TypedDict):
    memory: MemoryStats
    session: SessionStats
    profiles: List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

## Error Handling

The monitoring system includes robust error handling:
- Component unavailability detection
- Graceful degradation
- Error reporting
- Automatic recovery attempts

## Testing

Monitoring features are thoroughly tested:
- Unit tests for all commands
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Error handling tests
- Edge case coverage

## Best Practices

1. Regular Health Checks
   ```bash
   # Add to cron or scheduled tasks
   nova monitor health
   ```

2. Performance Profiling
   ```bash
   # Profile intensive operations
   nova monitor profile --name operation_name
   ```

3. Log Monitoring
   ```bash
   # Check for errors
   nova monitor logs
   ```

4. Resource Management
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check component health
   - Review performance profiles

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. High Memory Usage
   - Check memory stats
   - Review warning counts
   - Trigger cleanup if needed

2. Component Health Issues
   - Verify component status
   - Check logs for errors
   - Restart if necessary

3. Performance Problems
   - Create performance profile
   - Analyze bottlenecks
   - Review resource usage

## Configuration

The monitoring system can be configured through:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Command-line options

Example configuration:
```yaml
monitoring:
  log_rotation: 10MB
  log_retention: 7d
  profile_retention: 30d
  memory_limits:
    warning: 75%
    critical: 90%
```
