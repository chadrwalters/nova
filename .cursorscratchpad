# Split Phase Enhancement Ideas

## Content Separation
- Consider using markdown section separators (---) between sections for better visual hierarchy
- This would improve readability and match common markdown conventions
- Implementation would involve changing "\n\n" to "\n\n---\n\n" in the join operation
- Should be considered after verifying current fix works as expected

## Potential Impact
- Would make document structure more clear
- Easier to parse sections visually
- More consistent with standard markdown practices
- No functional changes, purely presentational

## Next Steps
1. Verify current deduplication fix works as expected
2. Test with various input types and sizes
3. Consider separator enhancement if needed
4. Document any changes in architecture.md
