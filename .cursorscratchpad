staginging is not real. We just are doing this on localhost right now.

should logs be in our root dir? Are they supposed to be someplace else? In our gitignore?

what about playwrite-report?

what about test results?

what about logs

flake8 in gitignore

alerts.db? What is this? What shouold we be doing with it?

playwrite.cofght?

Can we make it so there are fewer dirs in / created in our root and instead have fewer runttime or testtime dirs and use them
