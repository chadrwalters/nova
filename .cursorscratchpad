# Nova Development Scratchpad

<SCRATCHPAD>
- Notification system type issues resolved through proper HttpUrl handling and str conversion
- aiohttp import warnings are expected and don't affect functionality due to proper mocking
- Test environment properly handles missing runtime dependencies through mock classes
- Type checking is working as intended, catching real issues while allowing necessary mocks
- Next focus should be on cleaning up test files and resolving vector store type issues
