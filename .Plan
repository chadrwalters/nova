Plan for Implementing Color-Coded Console Output with Progress Bars on a Dedicated Branch
Below is a step-by-step plan in a Cursor-friendly format. Each task includes its current status (TODO or DONE). After all tasks are listed, there is a final progress indicator showing how many tasks are completed versus how many remain.

---
Task 1: Create a Feature Branch
Description:
• Create and switch to a new Git branch (e.g., "feature/improved-console-output") for these updates.
• Ensure the main branch is up to date before branching.
Dependencies:
• main branch is up to date
Status: TODO

---
Task 2: Update Dependencies
Description:
• Update pyproject.toml to include “colorama” (or another color library if preferred).
• Run poetry install to update the poetry.lock file.
Dependencies:
• Task 1 complete (new branch created)
• Working Poetry environment
Status: TODO

---
Task 3: Integrate Color and Logging Utility
Description:
• Create/modify a logger utility (e.g., src/utils/console_logger.py) using colorama or the existing color libraries.
• Replace existing print statements in the pipeline code with the new logger methods (info, error, progress, etc.).
• Ensure it supports both osx iTerm2 colors and a fallback for no-color environments.
Dependencies:
• Task 2 complete (color library installed)
Status: TODO

---
Task 4: Update Script Entry Points
Description:
• Update consolidate.sh and install.sh scripts to ensure the new logger is imported and used (if these scripts call Python code).
• Keep the rest of the workflow (directory creation, environment variable checks) intact.
• Validate that all color output is displayed properly in iTerm2.
Dependencies:
• Task 3 complete (logger integrated)
Status: TODO

---
Task 5: Testing and Validation
Description:
• Run the pipeline locally in iTerm2 (macOS) to confirm color-coded logs and progress bars appear.
• Verify that, under a --no-color or minimal environment, the script still runs without throwing errors.
• (Optional) Compare console logs against existing logs to ensure no regressions in data format.
Dependencies:
• Task 4 complete (scripts updated)
Status: TODO

---
Task 6: Documentation and Pull Request
Description:
• Update README or any internal docs to briefly describe the new logging system.
• Open a pull request from "feature/improved-console-output" into the main branch and request reviews.
Dependencies:
• Task 5 complete (tests pass, validated on iTerm2)
Status: TODO

---
Progress
• Total Tasks: 6
• Completed: 0
• Remaining: 6
