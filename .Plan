NOVA PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Last Updated: January 2, 2025

=== COMPLETED MILESTONES ===

MILESTONE 1: Core Validation (Completed Dec 2024)
------------------------------------------------
1. Attachments.md Validation
   ✓ Fixed orphaned sections detection
   ✓ Added image reference support
   ✓ Implemented attachment type handling
   ✓ Enhanced reference collection
   Result: Successfully fixed validation errors and improved reference handling

2. Cleanup Process
   ✓ Added validation completion check
   ✓ Added error state check
   ✓ Implemented cleanup stats
   ✓ Fixed directory cleanup timing
   Result: Cleanup now properly preserves files until validation passes

3. File Tracking
   ✓ Fixed per-phase file counting
   ✓ Added phase statistics
   ✓ Implemented unchanged file detection
   ✓ Added reprocessing logic
   Result: Accurate file counts and statistics now available for all phases

   [✓] Implement standardized error types across pipeline
   [✓] Add error context and recovery suggestions
   [✓] Create error aggregation and reporting
   Status: Enhanced error context with stack traces, system state, related files, and error chains

2. Logging Framework Enhancement (COMPLETED)
   [✓] Implement configurable log levels in config.yaml
   [✓] Add structured logging with contextual data
   [✓] Create dynamic log level adjustment
   [✓] Add log aggregation by phase/file/error type
   Status: Enhanced logging system with configurable levels, structured logging, and context

3. Debug Tooling (COMPLETED)
   [✓] Add phase-specific debug flags
   [✓] Implement detailed state logging
   [✓] Create debug mode with extra validation
   [✓] Add performance tracking in debug mode
   Status: Implemented comprehensive debug system with state tracking, validation, and performance monitoring

=== CURRENT FOCUS ===

MILESTONE 3: User Experience Improvements (ACTIVE)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Progress Tracking Enhancement (COMPLETED)
   [✓] Create detailed progress reporting
   [✓] Add phase transition logging
