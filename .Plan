# Nova Code Quality Improvement Plan

## Phase 1: Pre-commit Hook Setup with Overrides ✓
Priority: HIGHEST - Get pre-commit working with limited scope first

### Tasks
1. Configure Initial Hook Overrides ✓
   - Add skip rules for mypy
   - Add ignore patterns for flake8
   - Add exclude patterns for black/isort
   - Goal: Get pre-commit running without errors

2. Update .pre-commit-config.yaml ✓
   - Add skip/exclude patterns
   - Configure tool-specific overrides
   - Document override reasons
   - Impact: Working pre-commit baseline

3. Validate Hook Setup ✓
   - Test pre-commit installation
   - Run hooks on test files
   - Verify overrides working
   - Document current state

### Current State
- black: PASSING
- isort: PASSING
- flake8: PASSING (with overrides)
  - F401 (unused imports)
  - E501 (line too long)
  - F821 (undefined names)
  - F841 (unused variables)
  - F541 (f-string issues)
  - W293 (blank line whitespace)
  - F811 (redefinition)
  - E203 (whitespace before ':')
- bandit: PASSING
- mypy: DISABLED (internal error)

### Validation ✓
- Run pre-commit install
- Run pre-commit run --all-files
- Verify hooks pass with overrides
- Update .Plan with progress

## Phase 2: Mypy Errors (280 errors in 47 files)
Priority: HIGH - Start with type checking as it's most critical for bot interaction

### Tasks
1. Configure Mypy Overrides
   - Add type ignore comments strategically
   - Document each override
   - Group by error type
   - Impact: Clean mypy baseline

2. Fix Critical Type Issues
   - Focus on undefined names first
   - Then missing type stubs
   - Then type annotation issues
   - Remove overrides as fixed

3. Install Missing Type Stubs
   - pydantic
   - rich
   - psutil
   - bs4
   - docx
   - pypdf
   - Remove stubs-related overrides

### Validation
- Run mypy checks
- Remove working overrides
- Update documentation
- Track remaining issues

## Phase 3: Flake8 Issues
Priority: MEDIUM - Code style and organization

### Tasks
1. Configure Flake8 Overrides ✓
   - Add ignore rules for:
     - Unused imports (F401)
     - Line length (E501)
     - Undefined names (F821)
     - Unused variables (F841)
     - F-string issues (F541)
     - Redefinition (F811)
     - Whitespace (E203, W293)
   - Document each override

2. Fix Issues by Category
   - Start with unused imports
   - Then line length
   - Then undefined names
   - Remove overrides as fixed

3. Clean Up Remaining Issues
   - Fix unused variables
   - Fix f-string placeholders
   - Remove final overrides

### Validation
- Run flake8 checks
- Remove working overrides
- Update documentation
- Track remaining issues

## Phase 4: Black/isort Issues
Priority: MEDIUM - Code formatting

### Tasks
1. Configure Formatting Overrides ✓
   - Add exclude patterns
   - Document exclusions
   - Set up consistent rules

2. Fix Formatting Issues
   - Run black with --check
   - Run isort with --check
   - Remove exclusions as fixed

### Validation
- Run formatting checks
- Remove working exclusions
- Update documentation
- Track remaining issues

## Phase 5: Final Clean Up
Priority: LOW - Remove all remaining overrides

### Tasks
1. Audit Remaining Overrides
   - List all remaining overrides
   - Prioritize removal
   - Document blockers

2. Remove Overrides
   - Fix remaining issues
   - Remove overrides one by one
   - Update documentation

3. Final Validation
   - Run all hooks
   - Verify no overrides needed
   - Update documentation

### Validation
- Run full pre-commit suite
- Verify all checks pass
- Document final state

## Progress Log

### 2024-01-05
- Updated plan to focus on incremental pre-commit hook enablement
- Prioritized tasks based on override removal strategy
- Completed Phase 1: Pre-commit Hook Setup
  - All hooks passing except mypy (temporarily disabled)
  - Added necessary overrides for clean baseline
  - Documented current state and overrides
- Ready to begin Phase 2: Mypy Errors

## Notes
- Start with maximum overrides ✓
- Remove overrides one at a time
- Document override removal process
- Track progress in each phase
