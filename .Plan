Plan for Upgrading the Directory Layout on a Dedicated Git Branch
Below is a step-by-step plan in a Cursor-friendly format. Each task includes its current status (TODO or DONE). After all tasks are listed, there is a final progress indicator showing how many tasks are completed versus how many remain.
---
Task 1: Create a New Git Branch
Description:
Create and switch to a new branch (e.g., "feature/refactor-directory-layout") for the directory layout changes.
Dependencies:
• The main branch is up to date.
Status: DONE
---
Task 2: Define the New Directory Structure
Description:
Determine precisely which directories and file paths should store final output versus intermediates, caches, and logs.
Dependencies:
• Task 1 complete (branch created).
Status: DONE
---
Task 3: Implement Changes Incrementally in the Pipeline
Description:
• Update environment variables, scripts, and code references to place files in the newly defined locations.
• Consolidate caches and clearly separate final vs. intermediate outputs.
• Move binary files directly to their processing directories instead of copying to phase 1.
Dependencies:
• Task 2 complete (new structure defined).
Status: DONE
---
Task 4: Test and Validate on the Branch
Description:
• Run local tests to confirm final outputs are where they should be and temporary files are captured appropriately.
• Compare results from the new branch with the old structure to ensure no regressions.
Dependencies:
• Task 3 complete (changes implemented).
Status: DONE
---
Task 5: Document the New Structure
Description:
• Update the README and any relevant docs with diagrams or text explaining the revised directory layout.
• Specify how to clean up or retain intermediates if needed.
Dependencies:
• Task 4 complete (testing and validation done).
Status: DONE
---
Task 6: Open a Pull Request and Review
Description:
• Open a pull request from "feature/refactor-directory-layout" into the main branch.
• Gather feedback, run CI tests, and address any issues.
Dependencies:
• Task 5 complete (documentation updated).
Status: TODO
---
Task 7: Post-Merge Cleanup
Description:
• Remove local or archived test files.
• Monitor the pipeline to confirm the new structure is stable.
• Optionally delete the feature branch if no longer needed.
Dependencies:
• Task 6 complete (PR merged).
Status: TODO
---
Progress
• Total Tasks: 7
• Completed: 5
• Remaining: 2
