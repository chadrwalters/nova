# Nova Refactoring Plan (Updated)

**Target**: Complete implementation of new-architecture.md design  
**Overall Status**: IN PROGRESS (95%)  
**Immediate Priority**: Complete test coverage and documentation

---

## CURRENT STATUS & ALIGNMENT

Successfully transitioning from architecture.md to new-architecture.md design. The pipeline has been significantly simplified and stabilized:

1. Reference Handling (✓ COMPLETED)
   - Using simple reference markers with type indicators (e.g., [ATTACH:TYPE:MARKER])
   - Removed complex path resolution and chain depth tracking
   - Successfully implemented unique markers that can be easily looked up
   - Updated MarkdownWriter to support new reference format
   - Removed source section with relative paths from templates

2. Pipeline Phases (✓ COMPLETED)
   - Parse phase is working correctly with new reference format
   - Disassemble phase is correctly handling reference markers
   - Split phase is maintaining reference integrity
   - Finalize phase validation and cleanup fully implemented

3. Validation & Testing (IN PROGRESS)
   - Pipeline validator implemented with comprehensive checks
   - Tests updated to reflect new reference format
   - Need to expand test coverage for finalize phase
   - Need to add more edge case tests

## UPDATED MILESTONES & TASKS

### 1. Pipeline Stabilization (✓ COMPLETED)

1.1. Parse Phase (✓ COMPLETED)  
✓ Fixed file discovery in pipeline to use correct input directory
✓ Added debug logging to track file processing
✓ Verified handlers for all file types
✓ Added validation to ensure metadata is properly saved
✓ Added detailed logging of skipped/failed files
✓ Implemented retry logic for temporary failures

1.2. Disassemble Phase (✓ COMPLETED)  
✓ Verified reference markers are created and tracked properly
✓ Confirmed that disassembly metadata exists for each parsed file
✓ Implemented consistent skip logic where needed

1.3. Split Phase (✓ COMPLETED)  
✓ Validated that split only occurs on files needing it
✓ Maintained reference marker integrity during consolidation
✓ Handled attachments consistently with new reference approach

1.4. Finalize Phase (✓ COMPLETED)  
✓ Simplified reference validation to only check marker format
✓ Removed path-based validation
✓ Added reference marker existence validation
✓ Implemented comprehensive cleanup of temporary files
✓ Added detailed cleanup logging and statistics

### 2. Reference Management & Validation (✓ COMPLETED)

2.1. Simplified Reference System (✓ COMPLETED)
✓ Using [ATTACH:TYPE:MARKER] format consistently
✓ Removed complex path resolution logic
✓ Updated tests to reflect simpler reference handling
✓ Updated templates to remove source sections

2.2. Reference Validation (✓ COMPLETED)
✓ Implemented format validation for reference markers
✓ Added verification of referenced content existence
✓ Removed circular reference checks (no longer needed)
✓ Added comprehensive reference tracking in pipeline validator

2.3. Cleanup Strategy (✓ COMPLETED)
✓ Implemented removal of invalid reference markers
✓ Added logging of missing references for review
✓ Simplified reference validation process
✓ Added cleanup statistics tracking

### 3. Testing & Documentation (NEXT FOCUS)

3.1. Test Coverage
• Add comprehensive tests for finalize phase
• Add edge case tests for reference handling
• Add performance tests for large file sets

3.2. Documentation Updates
• Update new-architecture.md with final implementation details
• Document reference handling approach
• Add examples of reference usage
• Update configuration documentation

## RISKS & MITIGATION

1. Reference Management (✓ MITIGATED)
   ✓ Risk: Duplicate or invalid markers
   ✓ Mitigation: Using consistent marker generation, validating format

2. Missing / Incomplete Files (✓ MITIGATED)
   ✓ Risk: Files not being processed correctly
   ✓ Mitigation: Improved error handling and logging
   ✓ Added comprehensive validation in pipeline validator

3. Implementation Complexity (✓ MITIGATED)
   ✓ Risk: Over-engineering the solution
   ✓ Mitigation: Kept reference system simple and focused
   ✓ Removed unnecessary complexity in path resolution

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Complete Test Coverage
   • Add finalize phase tests
   • Add edge case tests
   • Test with larger file sets
   • Add performance benchmarks

2. Update Documentation
   • Complete new-architecture.md updates
   • Document reference handling approach
   • Add usage examples
   • Update configuration guide

3. Final Review & Release
   • Run full test suite
   • Verify all phases work correctly
   • Check logging and error handling
   • Prepare for release
