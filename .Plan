# Nova Test Implementation Plan
Last Updated: 2024-01-04
Status: [IN_PROGRESS]
Progress: 45%

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive test suite for the Nova document processing pipeline. The test suite will be organized into unit and integration tests, covering core functionality, handlers, and pipeline phases.

## Risk Register
- [MEDIUM] Time required to create appropriate mock test files
- [LOW] Potential conflicts with existing test configurations
- [LOW] Integration test complexity with async operations
- [LOW] Edge cases in file path handling and sanitization

## Technical Decisions
1. Using pytest with pytest-asyncio for async testing
2. Implementing filesystem mocks using pytest's tmp_path
3. Following AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern for test structure
4. Targeting 80% initial coverage
5. OpenAI API testing strategy:
   - Mock API calls by default
   - Use --openai-api flag to enable real API calls
   - Provide mock responses via fixtures
   - Separate test cases for mocked and real API calls
6. File path handling:
   - Sanitize filenames for cross-platform compatibility
   - Preserve trailing dots in filenames when needed
   - Handle special characters and Unicode conversion

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure [COMPLETED]
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Basic configuration management
- [x] Logging setup
- [x] CLI argument parsing
- [x] File system utilities
- [x] Error handling framework

### Phase 2: Core Module Tests [IN_PROGRESS]
- [x] Configuration tests
  - [x] Fix config validation test (not raising ValueError for missing fields)
  - [x] Fix path resolution test (environment variable substitution not working)
  - [x] Update config manager to handle missing required fields
  - [x] Implement proper environment variable resolution
- [x] Path utility tests
  - [x] Test sanitize_filename function
  - [x] Test empty and invalid filenames
  - [x] Test path normalization
  - [x] Test path validation
- [x] Handler tests
  - [x] Test MarkdownHandler
  - [x] Test DocumentHandler
  - [x] Test ImageHandler
  - [x] Fix OpenAI client initialization warnings in ImageHandler

### Phase 3: Document Processing [NOT_STARTED]
- [ ] Document parsing
- [ ] Metadata extraction
- [ ] Content analysis
- [ ] Link processing
- [ ] Image handling

### Phase 4: Output Generation [NOT_STARTED]
- [ ] Markdown generation
- [ ] Template system
- [ ] Cross-references
- [ ] Index generation

### Phase 5: Performance & Optimization [NOT_STARTED]
- [ ] Caching system
- [ ] Parallel processing
- [ ] Memory optimization
- [ ] Progress tracking

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Style Guidelines
- Use async/await for async tests
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names
- Add docstrings explaining test purpose

### Mocking Strategy
- Use pytest-mock for function/method mocking
- Create filesystem mocks using tmp_path
- Mock external APIs and file operations

### Coverage Goals
- Aim for 80% coverage initially
- Focus on critical paths
- Include error cases

### Resource Management
- Use small test files
- Clean up temporary files
- Mock large operations

## Next Actions
1. Implement integration tests:
   - Set up test fixtures
   - Create test data files
   - Write end-to-end test cases
2. Create mock test files for integration testing:
   - Sample markdown files
   - Sample PDF documents
   - Sample images
   - Sample configuration files
3. Set up test resource management:
   - Create test resource directory
   - Add resource cleanup in fixtures
   - Document test data requirements
