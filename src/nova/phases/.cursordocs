# Nova Phases Component

## Component Purpose
The phases component is responsible for implementing the core document processing pipeline phases. Each phase performs specific transformations on the input data, following a sequential processing model.

## Implementation Details

### Phase Structure
- Each phase is a separate module
- Phases implement a common interface
- Phases maintain their own state
- Phases handle their own cleanup

### Key Methods
- process(): Main processing entry point
- validate(): Input validation
- cleanup(): Resource cleanup
- get_state(): State reporting

### Integration Points
- Core handlers for processing
- State management for tracking
- Resource management for cleanup
- Error handling for recovery

### Developer Notes
1. Always implement all interface methods
2. Handle cleanup in finally blocks
3. Use type hints consistently
4. Document public methods
5. Include error handling
6. Track processing state

## Edge Cases
- Empty input files
- Corrupted markdown
- Missing attachments
- Invalid image formats
- Network failures
- API rate limits
- Resource exhaustion
- State corruption 

# Known Limitations

## Image Processing
- Image processing in the markdown handler is currently not functional
- A TODO comment is added to the markdown output for each image
- This will be addressed in a future update when the OpenAI Vision API integration is complete

# Phase Components

## Parse Phase
The parse phase handles initial processing of input files:

### MarkdownHandler
- Processes markdown files and their attachments
- Converts attachments to markdown format
- Currently has limited image processing capabilities (see Known Limitations)
- Maintains directory structure while processing
- Generates markdown-only output
