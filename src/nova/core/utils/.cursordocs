# Nova Utils Component

## Component Purpose
The utils component provides common utility functions and helper classes used throughout the Nova system. It implements reusable functionality for file operations, error handling, state management, and resource management.

## Implementation Details

### Utility Categories
1. File Operations
   - Safe file reading/writing
   - Path manipulation
   - Directory management
   - File validation

2. Error Handling
   - Custom exceptions
   - Error logging
   - Stack trace handling
   - Error recovery

3. State Management
   - State persistence
   - State validation
   - State recovery
   - Progress tracking

4. Resource Management
   - Resource allocation
   - Resource cleanup
   - Resource monitoring
   - Resource optimization

### Common Patterns
```python
# File operations
def safe_read_file(path: Path) -> str:
    try:
        with path.open('r') as f:
            return f.read()
    except Exception as e:
        raise FileOperationError(f"Failed to read {path}: {e}")

# Error handling
def with_retry(func: Callable, max_retries: int = 3) -> Any:
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except RetryableError as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
```

### Integration Points
- Used by all components
- Core functionality
- Phase implementations
- Resource management

### Developer Notes
1. Keep functions focused
2. Handle all edge cases
3. Document thoroughly
4. Include type hints
5. Write unit tests
6. Consider performance

## Edge Cases
- File system errors
- Permission issues
- Resource exhaustion
- Network failures
- Invalid inputs
- Type mismatches
- Memory errors
- Timeout conditions
