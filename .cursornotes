20240320 - Vector Store Search Implementation

Key Developments:
- Fixed issues with ChromaDB distance metric interpretation in search method
- Implemented proper similarity score calculation using ChromaDB's distance values
- Added normalization to convert distances to 0-1 similarity range
- Enhanced relevance scoring with weighted boosts for exact matches
- Improved test coverage for empty results and score normalization
- Updated MCP server integration to maintain consistency with CLI implementation

Technical Details:
- ChromaDB returns distances in [0,2] range, converted to similarities in [0,1]
- Base similarity calculation: 1.0 - (distance / 2.0)
- Added boost factors for exact matches, consecutive matches, and term frequency
- Implemented minimum relevance threshold (30%) to filter low-quality matches
- Ensured proper resource cleanup in VectorStore singleton

Next Steps:
- Consider adding configuration options for similarity thresholds
- Implement caching for frequently accessed embeddings
- Add performance metrics for search operations
- Consider adding fuzzy matching capabilities
