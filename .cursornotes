# 2025011 7:14am - Claude Client Test Improvements

## Test Suite Status
- All Claude client tests now passing (3/3)
- Fixed authentication handling in mock setup
- Improved rate limit error handling
- Enhanced streaming test coverage

## Key Improvements
1. Authentication Handling
   - Added proper Anthropic API headers
   - Fixed mock client authentication setup
   - Improved error response simulation

2. Rate Limit Handling
   - Updated test to use RateLimitError instead of APIStatusError
   - Implemented proper retry behavior testing
   - Added comprehensive error response mocking

3. Streaming Support
   - Enhanced mock setup for streaming responses
   - Fixed chunk handling in streaming tests
   - Improved async iterator mocking

## Technical Notes
- Successfully mocked Anthropic API client behavior
- Maintained test isolation with proper mock cleanup
- Improved test readability with clear fixture setup
- Added proper content type headers for API simulation

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more edge case tests
2. Look into additional streaming test scenarios
3. Consider adding timeout handling tests

Progress Update:
- Completed implementation of time range selection across all monitoring components
- Time range selector allows viewing data for 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d, and 30d periods
- All components (RateLimits, ErrorMetrics, ServiceHealth) now filter data based on selected time range
- Export functionality respects selected time range when downloading data

Next Steps - Filtering and Search Implementation:
1. ServiceHealth Component
   - Add dropdown filter for component status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
   - Add search input for filtering components by name
   - Implement grid updates to show only filtered components
   - Consider adding service type categorization

2. ErrorMetrics Component
   - Add filter options for different error categories
   - Implement severity level filtering
   - Update chart visualization to reflect filtered data
   - Consider adding error pattern recognition

3. Alert Search Functionality
   - Design and implement search bar for alerts
   - Add filter options for severity and status
   - Update alert table to show filtered results
   - Consider implementing saved searches

4. Filter State Management
   - Store filter preferences in localStorage
   - Implement filter state restoration on page reload
   - Add clear filters functionality
   - Consider adding filter presets feature

Technical Considerations:
- Need to ensure filtering doesn't impact performance
- Consider implementing debouncing for search inputs
- May need to update API endpoints to support server-side filtering
- Should implement proper error handling for filter operations
