# 20250110 7:29pm - CLI Test Suite Improvements

## Test Suite Status
- All CLI tests now passing (6/6)
- Resolved async testing issues in streaming query tests
- Fixed path handling in test fixtures

## Key Improvements
1. Async Testing
   - Implemented proper async generator mocking for streaming queries
   - Fixed coroutine handling in test_query_command_streaming
   - Simplified asyncio.run mocking approach

2. Path Handling
   - Created robust MockPath class inheriting from PurePosixPath
   - Implemented comprehensive path operation mocks
   - Fixed file system simulation in test fixtures

3. Configuration Testing
   - Enhanced mock_config fixture with proper dataclass instances
   - Added validation method mocking
   - Improved config file loading simulation

## Current Warnings
- PytestDeprecationWarning: asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope unset
- DeprecationWarning: NumPy internals from FAISS library
- RuntimeWarning: Expected coroutine warning in streaming tests

## Next Steps
1. Consider addressing pytest asyncio configuration
2. Evaluate need for additional streaming test coverage
3. Look into suppressing non-critical warnings

## Technical Notes
- Successfully mocked RAGOrchestrator's streaming functionality
- Improved test isolation with proper fixture cleanup
- Maintained test readability while handling complex async patterns
