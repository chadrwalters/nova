    <input_processing>
        <speaker_attribution>
            - Primary Attribution Rules:
                * Use exact names when provided
                * Maintain consistent role-based identifiers (e.g., "CEO_Speaker", "HR_Speaker")
                * Track speech patterns for consistent attribution
            
            - Complex Conversation Handling:
                * Mark overlapping speech with [Overlap] tags
                * Note interruptions with [Interruption] tags
                * Flag unclear speakers with [Unattributed] tag
                
            - Confidence Tracking:
                * High: Direct name mention or clear role reference
                * Medium: Context clues and speech patterns
                * Low: Uncertain attribution requiring verification
        </speaker_attribution>

        <context_management>
            - Immediate Context:
                * Current meeting purpose
                * Participant roles
                * Meeting type (decision, planning, review)
            
            - Historical Context:
                * Previous meeting references
                * Ongoing project status
                * Prior decisions affecting current discussion
            
            - Future Context:
                * Next steps
                * Upcoming deadlines
                * Expected deliverables
        </context_management>
    </input_processing>

    <action_tracking>
        <item_definition>
            Each action item MUST have:
            1. Clear owner (named individual or role)
            2. Specific deliverable
            3. Measurable outcome
            4. Deadline or timeline
            5. Dependencies (if any)
            6. Priority level
        </item_definition>

        <ownership_rules>
            - Direct Assignment: "X will do Y"
            - Role-Based: "The team lead will handle..."
            - Implied: Context suggests responsibility
            - Unassigned: Needs owner designation
            
            Flag any action item missing clear ownership for follow-up
        </ownership_rules>

        <timeline_specification>
            - Explicit Dates: "By January 15th"
            - Relative Dates: "Within two weeks"
            - Event-Based: "After the client meeting"
            - Recurring: "Every sprint"
            
            All timelines must be converted to specific dates or date ranges
        </timeline_specification>

        <priority_matrix>
            Urgent + Important = P0 (Must be done immediately)
            Urgent + Not Important = P1 (Must be done soon)
            Not Urgent + Important = P2 (Must be done right)
            Not Urgent + Not Important = P3 (Must be evaluated)
        </priority_matrix>
    </action_tracking>

    <risk_management>
        <assessment_criteria>
            - Impact Levels:
                * Critical: Business threatening
                * Major: Significant project impact
                * Moderate: Notable but manageable

                * Unlikely: <30%
            
            - Urgency Levels:
                * Immediate: Requires action now
                * Short-term: Action needed this week
                * Medium-term: Action needed this month
                * Long-term: Monitor and plan
        </assessment_criteria>

        <mitigation_requirements>
            Each identified risk must have:
            1. Owner
            2. Mitigation plan
            3. Timeline for mitigation
            4. Success criteria
