Raw Text: 

Probably one more. we're all. Yes, so that's a serious conversation about happen now. What do we got going on?  I now we are discussing Par. Okay. What are we discussing?  Parag one. it's it's a company, okay? Uh, so, something similar to Zati is also, if you know those guys. So it's automation, it has some really good uh kind of extra features that other companies other products they have. uh, but in general, they offer available blocks for integrating with fur companies, uh such as quaintbooks, uh, um Zorra, um yeah, many other accounting payroll and whatever other solutions.  Also, they have integrations with like a Google dogs, Gmail, whatever. So, uh, what you may typically need to to make like sales pipeline or something. So, real quick, like. um, I have zero contact. so if this is just a conversation around me so that you guys have contacts and I'm listening, cool.  This is to get some sort of opinion from me, I need some context of why we're talking about this. Yeah, that's what I'm trained to. We'll start with the why do we need. absolutely no problem.  So we's what I go? I'll go into how they explained that. I was explained that we need this thing.  So I was told that we need this thing as far as the weight to faster, actually add to our integrations, whether it be um, as we want to build out the marketplace for our system, we have a lot of people that want to integrate with us, uh, and we want to integrate with. um, so using something like this instead of building our own custom integrations every time, uh, would save us a lot of time and money. Depending on the integ. Yeah.  So they came to me with two different options, uh Musoft, which is by sales force, and this other one. um, which is a standalone company, paragon. Um originally Paragon's pricing was way too high. I was able to negotiate them down, so Musoft and Paragon pricing wiser about the same..  Uh, so now it's just going through who owns the data or all that kind of stuff. Mosoware protected, paragon, still a lot to look into there. but that's where I was brought to the conversations, uh Ion Serge, you want give anything else? Um I'm sure.  I'll add a little bit of context. uh so um you know, there's there's a couple of ways that like this thing is essentially some kind of like automation orchestrationatform and it's, uh, you know, for my one of view, like some of the bigger values are the built in integrations that they already offer. Like you could also use it to build custom integrations and that gives you like a somewhat smaller slice of value, like if built in ones that are great for us that's not very helpful. Yeah.  The what do you get from kind of like build your own custom integration to something else is you get kind of like the standards based authentication, like, ohath two or whatever. That's kind of built into their system and you can like configure it rather than implementing it for an integration. Yeah.  And as Sean said the actual number of prebuilt integration vendors that we actually care about isn't that big? I think we're talking about like ballpark of five, maybe. No, there's not that.  High end. So, like, what are these integrations? Like, like from five to 15, the how we count, but um it's not zero.  And I I think it's not insignificant for not to account for. It's definitely more than anyone else, uh provided.. What are the types of integrations that we interview with?  What's the business value that we're trying to get our customers? going through the list would make a lot more sense, but like the thing is like, some of the ones that are in the list are ones that we've already integrated with before our own way. So at that point of view, the value proposition is like for that particular one would be a little bit more shaky.  But maybe it's still at some point would make sense to port over into this platform, just for like future proofing purposes. But do we have needs, business needs for it now of something we don't do, we need it for we need to integrate with Space Ax to do, we have to integrate with a bunch of things coming up right now, like paychecks and ADP and PayCOM and a lot of different solutions. None of those are out of the box.  Quinics, none of the ones that are out of the box are on that, uh or on that list. Yeah, so, uh out of what they support. They have sage sage that the QuickBooks, Claudio, ADP casto, uh, we ourselves already have implementedeenooks and Sage. so it's kind of out of the list, but we can migrate them to use the platformance instead of our custom one.  They also have a bunch of CAM systems, then also zero and thatite, uh they have a bunch of ecom integrations, one of them shortified, but also other ones as well. Sales force that can be used for our internal integrations, sales pipeline or whatever. yeah, there's there's probably more stuff out of the box that could be used for internal tooling compared to things that we actually need for external integrations. Yeah, so this thing is great in a sense that it can be used for both internal and external. uh, most of the platforms that I evaluated, they only support one of the cases. uh typically, it's internal only.  Like Zoho, if you take that, yeah, it's great, actually, Zo is the best, I would say, it it really convenient to do things and it has other things like zoho forms which can be plugged in into this thing. Zo is great. but they only are suitable for it all internal integrations. So your sales company that this a sales team can benefit from that leads can be easily moved between systems and no problem.  In reaction in males, even parsing or mail content. That is great. But those guys also have that. and they also allow you to create integrations to be used by your clients.  It's a B2B to be. So they are a company, give service to us, which we can give to our clients. But our our clients going so, what's the business need we're trying to solve now?  Like, like we have these three customers that need Net suite. Like, what's the things that's driving us to look at anything? I didn't Peter, of mentioning any integration, uh at the moment sucks. most recent one, I guess was Claudio, Claudio took around a month to implement.  Sage took around three weeks, but it was built on top of quick books, which we had before, they were only slightly slight notifications in UI. The longest one was quick books that take around two or three months. a long time ago. The first one we had.  Now, uh still when you're comparing to that, like what we actually get out of this thing is fundamentally the connector. So, you know, all of the authenticate to them be able to make API call successfully like that definitely was not the entirety of the scope of QuickBooks uh a lot of the time and scope of QuickBooks was our actual business logic, which you're gonna have to write either way. Yeah.  So, both times I've asked this, what I've gotten is a bunch of answers that are this technical feature is good. I'm not asking that. I don't care about that..  No, no, hold on. Before I draw any I just grab this, but Okay. I don't understand why we're buying this at all.  Like, I get it, uh, we can do other technologies. I get it um, we could make another integration. Is there a customer right now saying, I need this thing integrated and we don't do it?  And therefore we're using this as a way that we're thinking about you changing our integration platform because we now have to integrate with this thing. So now let's look at something that'll do it all. Like why are we looking at this at all?  Like this second? So we're looking at what they're bringing to me is twin pacom, uh these solutions that we need for our largest clients. so if this makes it, like one at one point in time we were talking that, it could save potentially 60% of the time on those integrations, then, yeah, it's probably worthwhile if it allows us to scale the integrations. And February 15th now, right?  this is the different remember the clips focus team that you get to price focused team? So yes, those are going to the Quinics it definitely is. and the pay coms next in line. Yeah, but unfortunately, I think with I don't know what the deal is with PayCOM, but with Quinux that doesn't really fit.  Okay. So, let me draw. I think it will answer questions.  So, if I rightfully mentioned that there are some things that this uh integration doesn't cover, yet this vendor doesn't cover. So what doesn't cover? so this is like our integration for quick books.  That's what we've done over there, and this is part about. So, Paragon has things such as like SSO, which shows you the Quickbooks looking in portal with where you enter looking password, the token then gets like stored somewhere, let's say it's like a token storage, uh talking dataabways. And then there are some um, let's say, it's a connector or exporter uh, or some way of using external API.  So here, this thing, um sends data to the external system. That is also a common part between the things. and obviously the token is used by this exporter because it needs to export using the token. So that is the common part.  Now, obviously there is baked extraction. so what do you uh export? That is ours, absolutely. So that would be maybe a um selecting of the source database whatever. selection.  Then, umvergent data, it's kind of ETO, let's call it ETO. Uh, modified ETO, but still, uh, that is our stuff. What we also can benefit from is what is over here, what we have not implemented, but comes for free with that solution.  It's loing, uh it's monitoring it's um single place, uh so single place for everything. Just open this single dashboard and you immediately see if it works or not. Now, try to see it if this thing fails.  Where is even that? Is it in application sites? Is it in like grafana?  Where is it? Now, uh if we just ask some random developer, uh even the one who worked on that, if it works right now, if the last like when was the last last expert done by this thing, no one will be able to tell you. So, impossible.  But this thing has it. and the biggest one, let me just the super big bullet point. That is a marketplace. so we had this really great idea that we will kind of convert our software more towards like small businesses that they the ease of use uh gets like super simple, uh uh people, um don't differentiate between our application and the regular uh way of operating the phone, so it will be really simple for that. and, you know, iPhone has this concept of a marketplace, you can buy applications, whatever, so they are used to that concept. So that comes together with like paid features and stuff. and uh Paragon supports marketplace.  So all of their integrations, they have like a configuration that comes in place, and they not only store the token, but also some configuration per customer. So they say that customer A has this configuration customer B has like different configuration. So, different configurations.  And uh when the customer goes to some setting page, we can show them the embedded marketplace from Paragon. So we don't even have to implement this connect portal. Uh, Paragon has the connect portal out of the box.  You can customize DUI, so um SSO is just step one, you look at the connect button, it opens, the logging dialog. But after that, you can configure maybe mapping some fields or put some check boxes, all of that is configurable. It's a definition based UI. and it also can be a dynamic.  So for example, it's sales force. So you do the SSO first, then this UI itself goes to sales force using that token that you just stored retrieves whatever shows you here and from that retrieve data, you yeah, I want A, but I don't want B. So you do some selection and that is your configuration now. All of that is out of the box.  So if at any point in time, we will need to have like a self service set up, we have it. So let's also say self service. and we don't need to implement this ourselves, uh, for all of the integrations that we've implemented before, it was worked, that needed to be done. Now it's for free.  So they want our existing in is gonna be over on this? Um, well, there are, like two parel um streams. The first one is new ones. uh, they will be reported right away at the edit rightight paron and stream two is ported in Disney ones to Paron.  I want everything here. Okay. I don't want this custom work.  And the things we need over here day one are how how many new integrations do we need there day one? Sure, they have end of them, but how many do we need for the next release that we care about? Well, that's what we need to discuss right now because I don't know our long-term plans.  I know that we needed some payroll integration that have no idea what' in the next six months we needinics and a payroll integration. So you need two more in the next six months. until I say something different, like six months is our window of that from now on, like, let's talk about the next six months, whenever I say anything. And I was like, we I don't know anything, let's just try to keep it.  Some things similar like. So we need two more integrations. Now, if we had to all at each be honest, are these things going to get integrated in that same time frame, going to get moved over to the new way?  these are new integrations. one of the selling points that he's spending a lot of time in is we have all this other shitty ways we've done things. We can now do things in a better way, has logging, has all this other support. How many there's like Ford, ten integrations that way?  But how many will it handle? So let's let's say, um first, uh, the biggest problem I have right now is with GBE how how is the. Sally, you do supply.  PSSG, BSG.. Uh, We also have, you know, all the Pieser integrations, the globalment. Yeah, a lot of integrations are not really relevant to this because they are on in that is tied to the software generic words are being used generically, you're hearing you are hearing generic words for those things.  And I'm sitting here going, no, no, there's actually very specific things that we're talking about here. I still haven't figured out. Are they are they all like payroll processors andloyment processors?  So here, let's let's just run through a couple examples and um we can talk through a couple of things. So let's say, um first of all, a Quinix, it's a scheduling platform, okay? Um uh, there may be some part of the integration that we could offload here, but actually our idea for Quinics was the external API, which is to say that we are an API provider, we provide APIs in Web hooks and they integrate to us.  And they agree with that and from that point of view, like none of this is actually relevant because this is about us integrating to other platforms from our side, okay? Um so, uh payroll integrations and accounting integrations, um a lot of them are fundamentally, um a fancy ETL process out of us into another system. So all of those um, you know, like maybe it's a daily export, maybe it's a weekly export maybe someone hits a button, to you an export, uh but fundamentally, a really fancy ETL of our systems in need to prepare a bunch of data, it goes over to the target system.  That's how equipBooks looks, that's how Sage looks, that's how the payroll integrations will look. Um So let's hear let's run through a couple more. be listed here. Um DVE, BSG. uh that's actually that one's Chui and uh there are two things that we do.  We scrape a website and try it into structure data, and we essentially um fill the shopping cart from stuff that's it from actions in our system. What's the purpose of those integrations? So DVE, that's a largest supplier of beauty products in the world, so the point is to, uh make streamline for ordering for our customers.  So that they can order in this is the inventory one of these going to our system. So in other words, uh I'm ordering two sh Paul Mitchell shampoos, three Goldwell, you know, one color, you know what I mean? So it all integrates with our system.  So what what does that integration do every day then? It's an honoring system. Yeah, so it scrapes their website to get the full list of products, put puts that into a database. so that a essentially that can eventually flow down to the stores.  And when people actually go and place an order, it looks up pricing and it takes the item that they order and it sticks it into their webshop cart and they go into their web shopping card on the manufacturer or supply or website and hit the button to actually place the order and so are all integrations going to go into this new system? Um Mostly, I actually have really the least of things that are potentially me with the quick way of saying because you say mostly that means there are certain things that will not be. not payments will not be. And there's no pay there's nothing here, but um you know, uh payment integrations are fundamentally very tightly coupled to the actual point of sales software.  You can't run it through an extra platform. Okay. So your thesis then is there's already a lot of existing integrations in this system.  We have these most of the integrations in their system are not gonna work for us, the existing ones. I would I don't think there's much value in the existing ones. Well, there are two things.  There are existing connectors and uh there is a way to build your own integrations, but even that builder of integrations, it has so many things that we could leverage. First one is existing SSO it handshake. That is one of the most complicated things, uh and nowadays in most of those integrations, because everyone implements oha with differently.  And even there are multiple standards and different implementations of each standard. It is a hell. But then they also have this declarativeUI force set up portion of that.  And that is tremendous. Like it unifies everything and we don't need to develop dig just dragon drop and feel the definition. It's really easy.  So even the custom ones that are not out of out of the box, they still bring value. Yeah, I'm only interested in the custom once because I think that's where we can actually it's interesting for us as a company. The ones out of the box owner is interesting.  Yeah, the quick books, okay, we replace our existing quickBooks, but it doesn't bring any value to us. bring any business value? The thing that I'm struggling with right now is there's end different integrations right now. I fully get on board at the end not full I don't know.  It is more likely that I'm mind bored that the answer is, uh, we're gonna move all of those to this single platform. So whether or not it's a custom thing that's in their platform, I get it, because now because if if all of our stuff sucks and the answer is we're gonna move it all over here and it's gonna give us a bunch of stuff for free, understand that, but I just know it's not free. Like like and I'm looking at things going.  There's no way all these are gonna get moved over. So it's like, okay, cool. Now we have another system that has another way of doing things that's even harder.  So it's just another complexity to manage. So yeah, um I I will say there are several buckets of things. First is this BSG, which is a crawler so this Krowler does not have any customer facing setup portion, okay?  They just get it by theult. All sp per clips, they they get it. So we we will not benefit from all of those tokens and configurations, okay?  But at least we will know when this thing was last executed, if there are problems where we'll be able to debug, so, but you will know it when you migrate it. And so here here's one of the adages you'll hear from the million times. Working code is always better than refactored code.  Working code is always better. This is the problem. This is the problem it may be working.  We don't know. I mean if all of your customers then you get the customer support calls very quickly if it's not working or it's a useless feature because if no customers are yelling that it's not working, it's a useless feature you should remove it from the platform. But he says it's really important.  Probably it's being used. I. I trust you when you say there's no monitoring, you can't look at anything that't what I trust you I believe you mean not. It just you know it not a in general but having so we catch it before customer the problem of enhancing monitoring is important, but this thing isn't the only thing that gets us to enhanced monitoring.  And uh it there are and I think the ways of enhancing monitoring that do not require us to rewrite or migrate integrations is a lot more likely to um cover a substantial enough portion of our system to be useful than something that requires migrations. Now, you know sound like you agree with that. Uh, yeah, I I don't.  I don't. because we have so many custom things. Yeah. They are in different codeases, different looking at monitoring systems.  Some of them are not even registered. They go below the rider because they are just drove by the filtering. So we have like whatever, let's say, a thousand messages per day cap and when the thousand messages are used by other be systems that generate more traffic, those systems never get to logging.  So I don't disagree with that based on all the comments that from the development team as far as uh that it is just a mess managing this.. So there's a way we can actually, you know, if we have to do a few integrations, right, that this helps us speed up and gives us the better so to build off of in the future. I think that could be very good.  Yeah, but I think it's it's still uh very wishful thinking to think that um migrating all the integrations or as many of them as we can is the thing that's going to solve observability for us. But what'll happen in the real world is that we'll build the new integrations here, maybe we'll migrate one or two and we'll forget about the rest. Okay, at least it will be a single blaze, but if we go your way, which is let's add better monitoring to all of these that will be ten different things. it won't.  No, it won't. Well, tell me why not? Because the entire idea of improving the monitoring of jobs, which is really the thing we're talking about, is to put it all in one place.  So that is right. Not necessarily. We've we've already discussed this approach and it's it requires enhancing all of the code, but it is not tantamount to a rewrite.  Now, let's assume it is that's a semantic like, whether or not I write one line of code or a thousand lines a code, it's still a writing code. Again, my is working code is always better factor, but um like I feel like I'm walking into the middle of this has already been being discussed for a long time before.. what I'm confused about is I'm looking at you going, okay, cool. I my my my bias is what you're saying.  The answer is, if I had to bet right now, the answer is, we're gonna we say yes to this, we're going to implement this, two or three things are going to be over there. Nothing is going to be over there. Why do I think that?  just from all the code that I've read in the past two weeks and all the geer tickets that I see. I see that it looks like to me that my team does a bunch of stuff to one percent and stops. Now that is probably So if that's the assumption, why is his opinion wrong?  Because that was my opinion, but my opinion is stupid right now. I don't know anything. But when he said the same thing I went down, I was like hell man, I don't that's what I think and I don't well, um that's a separate discussion, uh why people don't finish things. let's start with the first principles.  We can't fix problem three and so we fix problem one and problem two if they're blocking problems. Now I don't know what our blocking problems right now, but if our blocking problem is our most imp like that's the reason I kept asking is why are we going to go build this? Because if you told me because this thing is the most important thing we're doing it's number one on that list chat and we need to get this, then it's clear like, obviously the answer is yes, but if the answer is, we're get something, I don't remember those words yet.  I don't know shit yet, but I don't remember those words from the list that I was given't have been on is the same thing asation. So maybe you have a task to move like a ton of weight from point A to point B and you use like a I don't know, real simple strollers with uh square wheels. You can't keep moving the old way moving to round wheels that will move faster.  What is the cost of moving to round wheels? We don't know, but maybe after this first project is done, the round wheels will keep helping you, but the square wheels will keep dragging you in the wrong direction, so all other timelines and minstones and deadlines will be compromised. if you don't do the move right now to round bills. This is round wheels.  So again, I don't know anything right now. Here has been my rule of film when one of my senior engineers wants to rep platform us. My answer is yes, as long as everything comes alone with you.  No, okay, okay. So it's it's like somewhat dramatic right now, all of those discussions and revealed everything. No, it's not revealed everything, okay?  We can keep those blocks that we have now, they will be just called from different place. but we' keep that stuff. That's okay, that cool.. What's the thing that we get for how much money?  What is like here is the feature that I can put on a website that the customer says, I want that. What is the features as I get for doing this day one? When we're done with version one, what's the features we get?  Yeah that a customer cares about? customer care is about the connect portal.. I just telling you the first day of training, and the answer is we want the software to fall into the background.  They don't care about a connect. Okay, they care about integration withbooks. they care about., no. Yes and no.  Why yes? Because they care about the final product they don't care about how we implemented it, whatever. But also know, because if we give them 10 different ways of doing the same thing, they will be like, what the Frankenstein is this?  So again, like like I'm trying to give you everything of the possible possible universe, like give me the easy answer. You are making the press release. What's the bullet point that my customer says and goes, god damn, I want that and they bought us.  What's the bullet point?. Okay, we can't discuss this. Maybe I'm not quick at coming up to this right now, but this is mostly behind the scenes.  Same as like square wheels versus co. I know that that is a perfectly fine thing, and again, sometimes we're gonna do a bunch of things that the answer is it's a bunch of behind the scenes things. It's a bunch of things that the customers are paying us to care about reliability and observability, but they don't care about those things.  Is this mostly in that bucket then? It may, but there also is advisible parts, you what the customer is willing to pay me an extra dollar month for. let they will not be happy at pain the current dollar if they see the disjoint disganized system is this gonna help us, I guess, with Quinics right now? It it definitely will.  Yeah, there are two places where we can use that forinics. How much money will it save us based on development time for the Cinics integration?, okay, well, Sean, it's it's hard to computeate that. Cool.  What do we need a computer? Do we need to spend time computing that? So there is if we're gonna go buy a solution, we need to understand what the what the cost what the what the benefit is.  And so if you can't tell me I have 30 customers that are asking to push a button that says QuickBooks, the answer is is something behind behind the scenes. It entirely going to be something that you can give me a benefit of it will be this much cheaper in development. It will be much cheaper and operations.  It'll be one of those two things if it's not a bullet point on the website. for operations definitely, it will be easier to implement, more stable, with better debocability. how we put some numbers to that I believe your gut. are there is this thing costs less than a single maybe close to half of the developer period.m is at 55 or I all is there an o we have to pay for other things? We may pay extra usage and that will be up to 55 now it will be like 47 at the first year. let's here. When it's done, what we get?  Yeah. Most of the things that uh was relates to UI SSO and whatever, what may account for like half or shirt over the development of any new integration that will be done in five minutes one developer. Who will be doing that?  development team who works on the mask not you, right? I can do that as well, as you can't, like again, itan also, but clearly is probably not me. So.  So the reason I'm asking this is, okay, um, I also don't love buying platforms for a team that isn't the team telling me they want it. So if you want it, but like if the if the developers aren't going, hey, this thing here buys me a lot of time, what you're doing is to say, hey developers, and listen, he at least isn't bought into some part of it. I'm gonna use him as a proxy.  He at least is a proxy of I'm not too sure. What I've learned from developers in 27 years is if you just give them to play the shit and say eat it, they don't often eat it unless you beat them every day. Yeah, I understand that why they can give them not just a solution that they have to use, but a working example.  So I will be really heavily participating in the squinix one that will use it. It's not a direct case for that because there will be no SSO part of it, but it will be still it still will benefit from the source, still will benefit from them. I will be participating in this, uh on the architectural discussions, on implementations is the for it to answer that probably we have to actually um go like for ac Quinx in particular.  We have to see where it fits. Yeah, we can't we can't. but I guess the first thing. Yeah, I would suggest the two of you doing that together.  You both right here right now? Yeah, that's why I came here. But it's not like in five minutes conversation. doesn't.  Okay. I'm just saying it we're very well can be used, how exactly we can discuss it. But there is use for that, but much bigger use would be in any systems like this.  Those are the target we care about right now.ics and then payroll. So second quarter we're gonna care about payroll. Right now we're here in the week Quinicks.  So those of the things that we care about. We could take a if we know exactly which payroll system or systems it is, we can, you know, briefly look at their developer documentation and see how well this thing fits. Yeah, but I mean, again, I'm not even as concerned about the payroll right now because we're not gonna be starting the payroll until the second quarter. right now we have platform decision, it's still valuable to look at it especially if the um, you know, how this thing fits into them is different than how this thing fits into Quinics. like I think having at least two cases where like these are future integrations we're doing.  We're gonna do them with this platform. It seems entirely prudent uh go figure out like if the platform is gonna be valuable for doing those integrations. Okay, but it's not just a platform, and and it's not supported at least of integrations they have.  It's a a change on how we are even approaching the development of a new thing, whatever it is. I don't think it's whatever it is. it's it literally is, whatever it is, because we can even move the jobs that do a cut appointment and moving to queue over here. Why not?  we can't. We can we can, but it what you end up with is an external scheduler for something that just triggers some API. that already is a big thing. Why would we?  It could we let's code. We can do anything. Why would we?  Yeah, okay. By the way, my why would he isn't, I think you're wrong. would be as why? Why would we?  Okay. fine. So, uh, we have this then, that moves uh appointment items to kill when the time comes. Okay.  So they sit in an appointment book for a while, maybe for a day, and then, like an hour before the appointment, it moves to Q. So now you can sit there. Whatever, the times can be changed. And when it for feelss, what will happen?  Either it's not moved there, so nothing is inue, or maybe two things are ine, and that's what we have seen we see you've already convinced me. I am I'm convinced our platform socks. I don't believe that, but like cool.  You't have to convince me that it's not observable that we're having lots of bugs. I've been watching teams the last couple weeks. Like, you don't have to convince me of any of that.  I'm there. What, you have to convince me of is this is the path forward and we can get the team to go along with it. Those are the things that I need to understand.  The rest of it're right, I'm there. Let's go fix those problems. go along is not a big problem. Like if we went with mule soft, there would be a way more opposition to mule soft, because mule soft is terrible for a user experience..  This one is like a hipster solution. Dragon and drop, really easy. Anyone can do that.  So, really easy interface, builders, um observability, their supports. Everything is nice and slick and trendy end. Like if it was new software, like, I don't know anything about this.  I bless everything you said is correct. Totally we should build our entire new system about that. We don't have a new system.  No, no. I don't I don't say we have to build the N. We' gonna deal part of it.  My point is, this new thing I'm still not understanding, okay we're not gonna convert a bunch of old stuff. We agree that the problem is the old stuff in the observability and the problem is the old stuff and it can create multiple appointments. We're not fixing that.  We're saying we're going to buy this fancy new thing, then maybe at some point will migrate things to it? And then it'll be fixed. Yeah, and the migration should be quick enough, uh, because uh we can keep most of those custom things that we have done.  We will just drop, maybe custom UI.UI, we will drop. actual extract of the oh, the logic, whatever, we can keep. Only some things will be dropped. Or maybe there is like a a job executor over here.  That one will will be dropped. Maybe whatever logging we had here will be dropped. But the actual piece of logic will be kept.  That's fine. So we'll just replace those with alternatives from here. we have to change the business logic so that it's observable? Uh, I actually think that changing those things so that they now become like visible from a single place or whatever or more tobacable will be harder than removing them and using those ones.  So, yeah, maybe adding like a better working would be just one extra line over here, just line of code. So that now there will be a new deskboard on an elk deck or whatever that shows you the looks, but you will have to put this extra line in all of those different places. you will have to maintain this thing, you will have to look at this and it will leave completely like par. The requirement of looking is the same whether it's this or that.  Yeah, but this one is a technical solution. It's for geeks, for developers. This one also can be used by support, by managers, its trend, and this thing has a rolebased access control, ECL, at access control is whatever.  So easier to open, to see. Sean can log in here and seeickBooks fails or not, no problem. Try asking Sean to log to Elk.  Yeah, but I don't want Sean doing either or that. I don't care of that possibleible somewhat? Yeah, it's just okay, Y, let's Yamen is an example.  She wants to know whether here sheet works or not. Just logs in here, checks whatever. she builds a new integration.lover Wizzer, whatever. She opens this clover Wizzer because it will be like a separates a bullet point there, one of the integrations, she click clicks on that, and there are recent executions, and she says everything is green, perfect.  That's it. They' really easy. Here, if we say, no, no, no, it's over here, that this is the the uh the charts that we use in development, we can give you access, oh, you will have to the I understand how the filtrate over here.  It's really geeky, but you can click like those fine buttons and and then you will see what you want. She'll say, I don't want that. That's too geeky.  This one is really easy. So it just more people can use that stuff. I know, it's like really simple, really small benefit, but the more people look at that, the faster we will realize that there is a problem.  So that's what I'm trying to simplify who is the first one to react, our customers, who call support and say your shit doesn't work, or weep proactively detecting that there is a problem. So I'm bored that that's a serious problem. I just when you had this rolled out, you haven't fixed that problem. and that's the problem. because so that's one might.  Well, I did it, but that's why I'm like so I I'm're a big on prioritization, and so like, I don't know how to look at him yet and say, these are your priorities, but I sort of given him a heads up of, hey, high level, I think these are the level of priorities. I'm looking at this going, there's tons of work. Do you agree version one, there's more than a little bit of work.  Well, if we be quakes, then yeah, because it will be not besidesics? Quick books. you really implement something that works right now.. I would.  Cool. That means you can sit down and give me a plan with costs, because if that is your plan, if you think this is that much of a big deal, he's not convinced right now. I can't read him yet.  I'm not convinced, it's not bringing any business value, but but here's the problem. We have a lot of stuff that we need to get done. I can't imagine that redoing something that exists now with the exception of hey, it breaks off if you tell me QuickBooks is also broken all the time, we never know, let's talk and think more about this..  But I don't think it's just QuickBooks that has that problem, but I don't know that there's Quickbooks and all that has that problem., like picked one it doesn't have the problems that we're talking about. it has a specific technical problem that needs to be solved because it's a foundation for future integrations. What is that problem? how we do this up for multiple stores. and that's costing us, what we can't set up a store.  It takes us too much time to set up a store. It's very order from, what is it? No, the problem to my best understanding is that um we're not really good at reuse because we have taken the worst tendencies of Microservice style architecture, and if if it's in another project, it may as well not exist when you start a new project.  Exactly. Because we had Quigbooks, the new requirements came in the new request came in that we need to implement Claio and guess what? We didn't take anything from people's integration.  Now Clavia is its own service with its own UI, life cycle, business logic. But maybe we should have used some of that. Again, maybe we should have we can't come back to the past, though, like we can't fix that, and that's the problem is this is So here's my concern.  We have projects that are critical for first quarter, second quarter, right? If this isn't going to help us significantly with those? Well, I don't know what those are, because our owners are not capable of coming up with any road map.  I have my number one or number two priority. I say number no, zero. except that cool. I whatever you want to do.  I have a problem with the site going down and having there, it's one of those two things. That's my number one or number priority and you can shoot me for the other one. I don't know. the answer is it's one of those two, but I'm there, which is when is today, I was like, God damn it, I was looking forward to being my first meeting today.  Agreed. It's either my number one or number two of the fact that I still don't understand a list means you all don't understand a list means crazy. Oh, number one on number two priority.  But again, didn't see quickbooks on that. Did't see Quinics on that either, but, I'm an idiot, so. Well, now Quinics is more something that we' working withbook on specifically, so that wasn't listed there.  That in the paper weren't listed there. those are priorities, but uh, uh, they're not associated with the whole culver project. And as far as Quinics goes, in payroll isn't as urgent a priority as Quinics. Quinics is a more right now we're working on it.  So if we're going to spend the money on one of these two solutions, right? I want helping with Quintics. Yeah.olutely.  And ask them has to be a return. It's first use case has to be that. Otherwise, I'm looking at you right now going, I don't understand something.  I don't understand why you're talking about this. Why are you talking about this? If it's not helping in that clober thing or a couple of these other things that I don't know about, why is this I'm saying this not as a're idiot.  I'm saying this as a I don't understand. Why is this your burning fire right now? Why is this?  Well, I made my own analysis and I I see that all of the teams are benefiting from this. That that's what I found out. If all the teams use this and you're right about how good it is, then the teams benefit from it.  But since you've already proven to me that when we released Claio, when we release quickbooks, the answer is they're not gonna use it because it exists in a different microservus. And so they're not going to go do that without changes internally to actually making it so they go do that. So again, why is this your number one issue?  Because this is important to you, so it's important to me. Why is it important to you? It's a change of mindset, how developers approach all new projects, because right now, whenever they are about to implement something, they say, oh, yeah, who will implement this cue here.  This message was here, this background processing service, this cue in that Q job mechanism. they just throw ideas because it's fun. It's always building better than using somebody else's could always.reed. They don't want anything about.  It's just fun to have a bigger system.'s it's fun to not worry about someone else's bullshit. You get to make your own bullshit, because every deal is convinced that they can make it back. It's.  But again, you can buy this without other things in place. They're not use it is an interesting question, like who is they? implies that we have an ownership of products.  We don't. So, no one owns books. one of the places that you and I. me and you agree on what a product owner' general job is, but my real answer is everybody on my teams an owner and they don't have to act like that. And the fact that somebody is saying, I don't care about other code over there and they're not looking at shit like that. and and and that you as an architect aren't making sure people are doing stuff like that.  Like, that's the problem.ressions not this time.? It has the wordown, it's not applicable to product owners. Maybe a little bit, but it's it's there is no team, okay?  which owns all of those things. Okay, so you give this to an hour, how's that different? Uh, well, we will have the easier laneenance so that any team will be able to own it.  But you just said that the problem is the teams won't own it. So, no, won't. It's the current situation.  No one owns. Well that they will or will not, as a different thing? So so we should first of all solve the ownership problem.  Well, it's it's one. Yeah, because when there is a request, support says, uh this uh PSG doesn't work. Who reacts on that?  We don't know. Okay, why don't we know? Because no one own it.  So he is here is where for a owner comes in place, uh, because we expect some prot owner to go to those or channels and look at those things there and react no one will react on this right now. No one. It will just go below the rad.  No one is looking at that. Then Sean comes in and and says, three days later, there is a problem with that, I'd say, like a vanasov and other people react on it. yeah. The vombachune and others. yeah, uh people w will react, but it it's true that it's only certain people, only after a little bit of prodding. is that it's not it's not necessarily the person who is most associated with this project or product and maybe there even isn't one.  It's just who are the like three, four people who are most responsible in general. So, like it's going to take me a couple days, I said at days, purposely, before I'm louded in between everything right now. But my question to you two is, you're the CTO and you're the chief architect.  What do you mean and developer on this team is doing things and you're not setting the culture and the way that they're doing it? I don't I mean I what? What's I don't understand that it's I may have an answer for on go first.  I will say later. okay. um So yeah, I think that that one's really a bit uh tough. I I think it's hard for me to understand true root causes. Okay?  I can only kind of understand some of the things that happen. um like as far as uh me personally, um I end up with a kind of uh let's call it isolated view uh from time to time for various reasons. um So, you know, one example in point was that, you know, what at the time when I first got uh put onto this workclift team formally, uh I started to pay way less attention to what any other team was doing. um because I was supposed to focus on this thing. uh the same thing more or less happens with other, you know, special projects, or other things that that take my attention kind of I don't think there's a um I've never been a good people manager and there's never been a good structure to support me in being effective at that. Like, you know, I'll uh no, I'll work with like Yvon Vlov and Ivan Gala from time to time because they're on the team that I'm on, but you know, the like the most direct manager of book of my team would be Olga, the project manager or a scrrummaster for that team, and uh, I never worked with her at all. like the only time that I maybe talk to her is as it relates to release planning, like we have a weekly release planning called uh um she participate in sometimes she'd ask me things about releases, but kind of that's it. So, uh I'd say that that leadership function just isn't really working well for me and I need to understand better how to um, how we set up the rest of the management structure so that I can plug into it to actually make that happen right.  A and kind of like, what kind of regular touchpoints would I need with the other more direct leaders in order to see that that's happening? Kind of like my leadership tends to be on a project basis. We're like we're working on this thing. and that even happens and that tends to come in an ad hoc fashion where like, okay, like, this workload seems actually three teams, right?  And and they're working on three different projects. And and I'm scaled on the sports club. team is three. Don't I already only have three teams?  No, they're they separated into soft teams. That's what we were talking about. So it's like yeah, but that's important that's important because there's um under the the whole sportclift team, there are three subte teams.  Each of them has their own individual sprints. um and their own individual dailies, so um they they function somewhat like separate teams, but it's like it's it's the same people that are they are involved with each other, so it's like it's Tory vodos of a bunch of involved three. and what I'm hearing is you're basically not staying plugged in with ol right, right. I'm I'm there's the one that I'm actually formally a part of and and the rest of them, I'm plugged in to occasionally, especially as I just noticed things, you know, like something happened. I I noticed it, I set up some meetings.  I worked with them, so like, you know, like, two weeks ago or so, like that' what happened with uh and I think that's his problem with that. I think a lot of your other problem with that is how much of the legacy stuff that you're managing on a day to day basis. That's really not I mean, uh on a day-to-day basis, that's not a significant time, maybe it's not on a day, but you are a go-to person in case no one else reacted yes that is less about managing legacy systems, is more about um the fact that I am the only tier three support, like after one PM.  Okay. Okay. It's an operations.  Like, your uh, I am technical operation. You have a full-time job right now, which is you are coding on a team. That's taking up fifty percent of your time.  Then the rest of it is what you can do for the company as a whole slash you are level three support for the company because you're the guy in Austin. You that everything you rolls up to.. I'm sorry.  Do you have I have the rest of the day with you and with you, so my answer is we can figure all that shit out, let's keep doing this. How about you? I have three things to say, so first of all, about the ownership. um it requires some diet into history.  We had um I would say several big reorganizations. the first one happened a long time ago, like close to seven years ago when I joined. uh I tried to bring product ownership here at all, just because there were zero, no proton. There were designers who may be acted as prot owners, but no official protoners. And I wanted to say that there should be people who do that stuff, uh and they have to have this title, because with title comes list of things and it's not just on random things that we may ask, but just go search a video or what proton should do, learning in ten minutes and that's what you should do.  So it's it's easy when there is a standard, because if there is just some wishful thinking, hey, you should you have to do this and also you have to report on me and to me every day and whatever. It's just it's random request. But a proper title comes with certain responsibility.  So that was the first one. I would say didn't really went, uh, well, uh, in a sense that there was opposition, but eventually, uh we as a company got this idea. Uh, then the second big thing was introducing departments.  We couldn't go to scrrum immediately, uh so we went into the departments, uh it would be like a QA team, the back and the team, the front and team. Each of them had leads. uh, and uh it was good, maybe, but it also had some problems because uh if you have several competing priorities, how this beckon decides what to work on and the product owner becomes like a scheduler, trying to buy some time of their team. so it's it's not great. Yeah, you your masking you're making an engineering problem a business problem.  Those teams never work.ont and back end teams don't work, yeah. absolutely. Well, we went through this thing, um made sure that we do the proper transition to sc strong teams. That's where we lost some people, uh keep people, I would say, but we made it.  And I think it was the best decision ever. John may agree or disagree, may be more agree I don's just go with where we are. um and focus on that, because I think that's.. It's really important to understand. because after this transition, we went into scram teams and it was really great because those teams owned something, okay?  One team fully owned newer, another team fully owned boop bike. And they create those products from scratch. At that time it worked because they were not doing any other things.  Only people buy, only new mail. Once those products were done, they went into kind of maintenance mode, and yeah, well, we can discuss whether they were really fully done or not, because there is some remaining scope, uh, but um at least, uh they stopped doing the regular things of developing this product. and they were reprioritized to sometimes look at other products. So book by team started looking at parts of a regular admin pages, we call them maintenance pages.  So they went into different products and started doing features there, conflicting with the other team who did the same. So what we have now, all teams working on all products, all of them, and that's where we have a problems with releasing, because hey, I have my changes in upcoming release, but also there are your changes. Can I extravert them or what?  Cherry picking doing some things like magic with fisher flag or whatever. That becomes a mess. So now, maybe we need some other alternative structure, but what we definitely lost is ownerscean.  There is now no ownership, and it may still be somewhat present for big products, like built by and new mailer historically we have team who originally worked on that, but for smaller things, like the squig books integration or BSG, there is no ownership. People who implemented them left that and no new people were hired to fully.reed. Some team has to say half of mill that they own it and if you're in if you're telling you right now that there are things that people don't know they own, you're right.  We have to clear that up. The answer is, here's the boundaries, you own everything in this box, even if you're not working on it, you support it, you own it.. And that but what do you own?  What do you own? Well, at the moment I own the kind of own the integration, because it's not official. I was consulting them and there was a product owner, but separate discussions.  So integrations and those organistration platforms and stuff. Okay. And infrastructure.  You said liberations, so that's why I'm going to ask this question. I swear to you, I'm not trying to be an asshole. If you own the integrations team and all these people are integrating in various different ways every single time, and there's no observability and there's no nothing.  What are you doing if you own that team? those integrations happen before this team was created you own it. And so like, I have to up keep my house because I own my house.  I don't only add the additions to my house. I have to make sure my house works. What are you doing?  No, that may be true. Still, you have no idea who was killed in your house and if it' switched five dollars already or you do you've been here for seven years. You know where all the bodies areberried.  You just told me you owe the integrations. What are you doing? Not um yes and no.  Okay, wait, hold on. You didn't yes and no tell me you owned it. You told me about it.  No, no, no, no. So there is a Queen Hook's project. Okay.  So there is a discussion how it should execute who raised the UI, who writes back and whatever. And there are some people doing that, okay? There is only like a small portion of actually integration and there is a some other logic over here, some other logic in the UI set up and stuff.  That is done by different books goes down. Are you all over it? That's the question?  That's I' asking you one.. From now on and any integration goes down, you on. Right?  Why why is that not the right answer? well, it may the right. Why is it?  there is no. I'm not expertise than most. Okay, well, you lived in the US.  Do you know who prints dollars? The print dollar? Yeah, who who actually owns the the print machine who prints that?  This is that out there is a whose faulty is I understand who owns it. You use dollars, but do you know where the air printed? So you have some relation to dollars, but you don't own the full process.  What does? Okay, uh I would like to answer this particular thing and then we can go to the ownership, which they want which thing you want to sell. Uh, the integration fails, what do we do?  And as Ivan sometimes becomes like they go to person, I also uh do the same thing. So maybe we are the two go to people, okay? And um something fails.  I go to the domain name, look where this thing is going. Okay, this idea address. I go tovious, where this thing leaps, where the idea address is shaded like with a real server.  Okay, then I go to our um internal configuration tool. I find which server runs which service runs on that server, do some bunch of other digging, then finally I realize, okay, it is this project which failed. Okay, now we know the reposes.  Perfect. Now let's do the digging, why it fails. It's a research every time, every time. because there is no ongoing work with that repository, no one knows how it is structured its resear every time.  Yeah, you can say that. Oh, no, now you were appointed to do this and that. So white fails?  I don't know. It was created a long time ago, what what happens there? I have no idea.  Maybe in case of the Krowler where it was this one. The the thing that we crowl is now changed. It has a different UI.  That's why the crawler feels, that most probable thing, because no one touches it right now. Who will write the new Krolller? Yeah, we don't know.  So we we go and say, who was the last one working on this reportory? Who can do the Krolller again? who can redo that stuff?  Maybe we're lucky and there is a developer who works on that and there is enough like free time to work on this. Otherwise we we find other developer. It will be longer obviously because you have the context to pick up, but that is how it done right now.  So yeah, you can say, I own all integrations right now because there is an integration name there, but it doesn't mean that we have the expertise. So we have to do this digging. So I believe I own all the integrations now.  I believe I own. ownership doesn't mean I do everything and it doesn't mean I know everything. It just means who's the person that when someone's throat needs to get choked, where does that person go? And so my expectation is from now on very soon, he comes to me and chokes my throat.  Yeah, well then you have someone that is the problem. because you don't do the actual work. So your throat may be choked only for like ten seconds out of six0. I'm on board.  No, I want you to play back what you just said to me versus this new platform you're talking about, building. This new platform. I'm gonna grab a drink. anyone want any water or anything?  lunchtime, so. I don't have lunch? Yeah, I haven't because grab some lunch..  Go. so much. I never eat, so I never eat. I may grab a like I had a a to eat bar there.  And that's the most I'll do for it'll never be around me. You need to go eat, go eat., you're in European time, girl. eat, yeah, I I don't know. I'm coffee right now, so maybe I will also take a part.  I get to the bathroom anyway. lunch? lunch. I. 
.. I'll have two, so, uh you may have the second one. two seven. I don't need any, but thank you.  Okay. So where will react before. Yeah, and we we were somewhere between ownership and just the discussion of like what actual changes do we need to do to solve the problems?  I I'm struggling that what you were you were looking at symptoms of a problem versus the problem. No, well, I I I guess I was trying to answer too many questions at the same time. Okay.  Uh, but maybe let's uh move to the one where you said, uhha, so uh let's take uh this last thing as an example, that happened a couple of uh weeks ago. Which then? Clover freezing, okay.  And you may have heard about that by by different terms, like uh freezing, uh I out service uh um a bunch of other names. So, uh officially, we uh picked a person who will look into them. Arkali, our as the young guy.  A manager. Yeah. And he said, look in, what does that mean?  Officially he will do what? What's the goal of what he is doing? To resolve the problem and make sure it never happens again.Ms developers?  this particular one is. they may look into technical things. And we especially needed a guy who may look into technical things because Yamini is not having this skilled and uh neither John, uh neither Olga. So no one from management, um a team, let's say, uh in bookby can handle this..  So it's only arch cutic and he is in that team. So, uh, obviously it would have been great if he prevented that in the first place, but now we have the problem, so he has to make sure that it's done. and there are several criteria for done. The first one is that we now have customers uh kind of satisfied, and that may be done anyway, like data fixes, temporary fixes, whatever. uh, we call it short term fix, so that now there is no fire anymore and customers can operate.  Then we have to make sure that someone who works on a long term solution and eventually we remove all of the crap workarounds that we added, and it's now back to normal, um development. We have no mass in branching, uh everything sits on the correct code, latest and greatest. That is called the long-term fix.  So we wanted him to oversee both long-term ens short term and uh uh I don't think that he is actually doing that. Okay, what do you think that? Because he only replies like sometimes and the answer is not complete, so he may address only like one point. like, yeah, we are planning to do more tests.  Like, I don't care about this. I need to know what is the short term fix right now and what is the long-term fix? And what about the timing and effort and hoopby?  Is there anyone working on that right now? That's what I need to know. But he answers like on like some part of it only. and uh, that's what I'm saying.  Did you let him get off at? No, he's still on that. Okay, did you say you didn't answer my question?  I need.. giving you? that. I don't want to babysit any of those guys unfortunately, that' leadership.  I like listen, I wish my job wasn't fucking babysitting. Unfortunately, I believe half my job is babysitting. The other half is fucking shrink so that way I can try to convince people like people management is the worst job.  It's the worst job. And what I see at this company on my team at least is a leadership vacuum. So I don't look at a bunch of individual right now and looking through gitub and going or get lab and going, these people are idiots.  I don't think that about a single person yet. We'll see. what I do think right now is there is an absence of leadership. There is nobody helping to keep things going.  Now, you both have titles and ten years at this company that I'm looking at you guys going, hey, I can't fix it by myself. So at a minimum your seniority and your titles or you mean, I'm bringing you along with me.solutely. And we definitely want to help you fix it and, you know, I think from the leadership side, like it's gonna make a lot of sense to kind of go through the people in any kind of the leadership positions one by one and just give you our stock on where we're at with them to see where they're the what what raw materials do they have?  Yeah, because right now, when, you know, I can't use the last two and a half weeks, three weeks with me being halfway here, Washington's, as Ed against anybody. Though I do have a strong opinion of one human being right now. that human being, I have a very strong opinion and I bet that they they're not gonna work. And that person's name is John.. C getting him to answer things as a product owner is not what I'm used to and I find it really badly coincidental that my first day he's sick. It happens. I just don't believe in coincidences.  So I don't.. Everybody else, my answer is, I think there's an absence of leadership. and therefore, if you need to tell them, you need to tell them the next day, you need to make sure they're they this is what my expectation is. You need to hold them accountable, like, and that's you call it babysitting.  I don't have a problem with that because the answer is I feel the same way, but the answer is you need to be clear about what is needed, when it is needed, and you need to hound fucking people. And when they don't hit, then you need to make a big deal that's what I'm here and I will help with that. But that's my looking going, cool.  They didn't give it to you. It's on you because you didn't make them give it to you. Yeah. here's the thing.  Here's the thing. That's exactly what happens. So we see that someone is not doing things and we go and fix the day, okay?  Me and one. I personally don't want to be this hero all the time. Yes.  Don't want anybody on my team to be that hero. Agreed.. Yeah, maybe maybe Yon has some, like a intoxication with whatever hormones uh, if he does that, but I I I' done with it.  Uh, and um uh I want to do aate the right way, so that they actually start doing. and I have all of those like a one on one sessions, well, actually, those guys are not even under me. That that is another problem. but you have a soft power role, you don't have a hard power roll. same thing with you. You guys will have limited to no hard power.  You have to know how to use soft power. And that's what I try to do. I gave like whole possible hands and uh I gave a bunch of checklists and whatever.  And I I checked your article on people and then I see it that uh they are not doing everything. Maybe they somehow participate, but it's not enough. Okay. and um uh what should we do that?  Okay. So let's use the clover thing as as the as the prototype of what we're trying to get to. So you're saying that with the clover fix at a minimum, which is useless one, that the answer is there need to be a short term fix and a long term fix, short term is basically stop the fucking problem from happening, long term was something else.  I and what I heard is, you needed this, this person to articulate what the short-term fix was, who's on it, and by articulate short term fix, that means a ger ticket, right? do I have to fight that too here? would be nice tickets.  There are, but the answer is no one writes code unless there's a je ticket. Is that a truely. So I regardless.  Worst thing about is you have to be perfect emulating the behaviors you that's what sucks. We are the worst at standard. Okay, well good news is I'm not, so do you believe this person who's the person, by the way, Ark?  I'm going to say it wrong. That's why I' Ark? He goes by.  I've spent a year in Ukraine, so I've been over Ukraine a lot, so I've been around, but it's been a long time since I've been. just a second think what is this? Time to meet more. Just this.  I have it in let raise this. because it's interesting, but I don't think important right now. Has Sean announced me to the team yet? Um, good question.  Uh. let me, uh let me see what announces have been done. Okay. um but I don't know like about anything that he's done like, you know, personally verbally or whatnot. Um, but he can't do anything verbally to this everybody in Europe, so well, I mean, there' steam's calls, so not in person, just that may still be something that doesn't get recorded that searchable.  Okay. Yeah. So, the only one that I know of for sure is that, uh, you know, there's been the standard HR welcome announcements?  Yeah, that you guys on join the company? Yeah. You know, got to. and that's that's the only one that I'm sure.  Well, I just asked him to is like, is he going to do something and like how does that factor into this onboarding I have this week where like most of my week has already like beating out. So yeah. So, where I'm going to get to with him is my guess is this stuff still isn't done, right?  The clover the short term in the long-term plan. He doesn't know what it is, which means you don't know what it is. Well, um I really actually have a bit more context than because I was a little bit more involved with a few of the actual fixes.  Sorry. Do I need here's. Uh okay, so uh name pronunciation out of the way, dark it is, uh Okay, so arc own the short term in the long term plan for this issue.  Do you understand those short term plans? Did he articulate it and execute on it? No, he did nothing.  I uh I joined on the second day of the event. and he was uh participating in the first day. there were some discussions. They even caught one of the developers, like still working at the time even though it was like too late, still they found. uh a person and he did not do any follow up, zero. Whatever they researched at night was not passed to the morning crew.  No one knew what they did. When you say morning crew, that means people here, right? No, no, no.  European morning. Okay, cool. most of the developers are not here.reed. I I believe my numbers say 64% of my team of my developers are not in Serbia or Austin. medium.  Well, now we have less people because they they leave every day. So, maybe soon there will be only Austin guys. Okay, well what come back to the look they leave every day, because that's a a refree.  I've heard a lot of in the past couple hours. Okay, so he owned a short terminal long-term plan. is anDM. At that time, no one communicated to him that he has to do that.  Cool. But we had prior conversations his own boarding and he knew back. that. You communicated this time what you wanted from him.  No. You just me a different question first. So did I know about short term?  I create that. Okay, because he didn't pass anything to me. I am in Serbia at that time and I have to do other things.  Now when you face with that and I go and work with developers, we create a short term solution. and we execute it. And then I pass it to him. now go do the other things, please. Nothing.. sound vague participation, and then again, nothing.  Okay, so let's be specific. What is it you still need from him? I am still not sure if this thing is fixed.  K up until like a few days ago, there still were some cases that it was freezing or whatever. Is that the only thing you still need from him? for this case, yes, but uh let me make sure because I I thought I was listening.  I thought you need a long term plan from his well to stop it from happening in the future. I thought it was stop the fire right now, short term and then long term how is it. I thought that we are done with a short term because at that time, the customers who had an issue reported they it was resolved.  So I thought it's fine. But then, even weeks after we still heard some remnants of this, like, oh, this customer aheaded. Why is it happening?  Maybe it had like an outdated version of application, whatever. I don't care. I want someone to be on top of that to make sure no more crashes, no more freezes, nothing happens.  And then in parallel, there should be an investigation research, wherever to do the long term fix. Yeah, because we don't know still what is causing them. Okay, what I would like you to do is teams, I don't know what the right verb do use.  Okay. To him and me. Confirming what you still need and asking him for a date of when they will be done and at and making sure that he understands what you're asking for.  Are you clear with what I'm asking for? When can you give me a date of when I will have A B and C? That's simple as that?  Cool. I've done something like that without you, but now it's not like it'll be something else now. but what's more important is we'll get with meat like these are things I'm good at. Like I am good at processing.  I am good at organization, and I'm good at making sure people have committed not. But doesn't mean that everything that you're gonna want that someone to do we're gonna get signed up for they're that thing. But the answer is we're going to be clear what our expectations are from each other and then we're going to execute or we're not going to execute and then we're going to evaluate what's going on., let's back to the original questioning.  I am down choking this like dead turkey. I understand. There is nothing coming out of it..  So now, who is the next one? De developers. I go directly to developers fuck this guy.  Okay. Well why is he still hired? If the answer is fuck this guy, he is hired.  Yeah. There's a bit more complications on that I can walk you through that. What's the what's the two sentence version of why?  If he can't do his job or won't do his job, why is he still here? the uh two version is that no, we haven't quite gotten around to it and it's a little bit more complicated than usual because we're gonna have to probably deal with more severance than usual because we had this guy relocate. Do you believe he shouldn't be here?  Wait, is this the Canadian? This is okay, someone I had a conversation on Thursday about the Canadian. Uh okay, got it.  Know who it is now? know exactly what it is. I still need you to do this if for no other reason, cause I'm here.  So the answer is, I'm going to make the hiring firing decision. No one helps. And so he's either going to be irredeemable.  I can't fix him or my thesis right now is an absence of leadership is why people weren't doing the right thing. That is my thesis until somebody proves me wrong, then it's a different story. And the good news is is you guys get to be all like heart strings and bullshit about he moved here?  I don't give a fuck. So that's all for you guys to feel bad about because you guys hired somebody into a leaders list position where only the most exceptional humans can go figure out what to go do and do it and hold themselves accountable. Like that's a exceptional human.  Most people aren't that. Well, you can bring my one or once. I gave him all possible hints.. explaining that all of the problems, similarly to how we are doing this now..  I went through this, I chewed like I I swolled it on the half of him. And he said, yes, yes. Yep.  And that reminded me like introduction with Chinese, like I went through the course they always say yes, no matter what happens. That means I heard you. Or maybe I I'm just here.  I'm notding. I I didn't understand anything, but I would just say yes. That reminds me exactly the same thing.  He says yes, and does nothing. and that's probably the second reason why I wanted to say why this case is complicated. They waited for you. You have to make the decision.  Oh my God. Oh my God. The number of times um so I'm while Shawn didn't exactly tell me, hey, Chad, I think you're going to have to fire this person.  He told me everything but that last week. Every job my boss gives me you're going to have to fire this person and every job I go, why don't you do that before I get here, I don't understand. Like, why you bringing that for me?  Like, I don't understand. Yeah, that's a wrong way to kind of give us to you, so you obviously have to first understand what was the problem with the person this guy? He is an Halifax in Canada.  He is from Russia originally, but he moved I don't know when. Oh, yeah, cool. All right.  You're gonna do that, we're gonna figure out a response to that.. what that we do is it' create a verbal contract. He like, Im cool with him arguing you going, hey, I don't understand what you want, cool. get I will help you get to. Let's make sure the request is clear and then you're going to let him give you the date of when he will get it.  Now he may say something stupid at which point me and you'll go. OK, wait, you need three months to give me that. I don't Tell me more, please.  But assuming it gives us something realistic, then we'll hold him accountable. He'll get it, we'll see his results. And then we'll iterate from there.  And again, it is we'll deal with him what it is., he has the same respons all the time. We are still gat more from the day, we don't laws, we can have like one day delay. Let's wait for tomorrow and since then, every update was we are getting logs.  What the fuck are you doing? So, you didn't like my thesis. I'm still standing by my thesis, which is, you have a bunch of people that are doing nothing. what I didn't like if you got the proxy version of my reply, what I didn't like is that you answered without going into enough context.  But I looked at all their commits,use me? I get it. I don't have all the context.  I looked at all their git commits and I looked at everything in Jira. What do you mean I had no context? or enough context?  so maybe you didn't get the proxy of my comment talking about our conversation.se to my team's thing a week and a half, two, weeks ago. where what I thought I learned from you there is yourory pictantic about details. And therefore, if you see a detail that's wrong, the answer is you immediately go to the detail, you can't genericize once you see something that's a problem. Once you're like, I don't agree with that one piece, but you agree that a lot of people on this team are not working, not doing anything.  You agree with that statement. I agree with that, but it's more about management. I think developers work more.  And how many develop how many commits does the developer need to do every week on average before they're doing enough? It depends on what they're doing on their. Cool.  Cool. But I would say that corruptly maybe 15, 20 per week. That should be a okay. could be something like that, right?  How many developers developers do you think are putting in less than that in a week? But hold on, like like what I've seen from you also is engineering's fine. It's the fucking managers that are all assholes.  No, no, no. So, uh what I said is that it's anon and the top layer is management. Once we peel that off, there will be development What's the excuse for a developer doing no code?  they have no tasks given to them. Ah, so they're just taking my money without doing anything. Is that acceptable?  I find that not only acceptable. They're stealing. I think that they're stealing from us.  They can wouldn't. the answer is and how we do it wrongly and whatever. All those will come out a bit. However, why are you why are you carrying water for a developer who doesn't commit code?  That person isn't needed. No, I am with that statement. If everything else is also taken into account.  Like if if we the discussion the daily or on like wedding calls, maybe there was a task for um monitoring something for two days and making sure nothing happens and everything what they did is a stare at the dashboard. I don't know. I only look at some like byproduct uh metric, which may not convey the whole thing.  Maybe the product owners have a whole bunch of other work they're doing also. That's also really important. I don't know what all they're doing, but maybe they're working on something more important than than being a product owner. well could be.  But we have like five or six expectations and sometimes only a few of the are, sometimes none of them are not. So I understand writing code is one of those uh the checkboxes for developers as well.. Given some context that that they have work to do. or they were at least given the plan B, if there is nothing to do, go do technical.  Let's assume they haven't done anything in a month. But I agree. Let's not take that as a personal insult on that..  Oh, wait, you'd fire them right now for sure? They have done any code for a, but a month is definitely enough. Two weeks. probably sort of shady, but okay, because my answer to all of it is, huh?  It's probably a leadership problem, but I probably don't need that developer if they haven't coded anything in a month. Let's just go, look into all of. Did you spend time with jellyfish?  beyond the screens that you've sent me not yet. Okay. Well, I don't even have access to this jellyfish.  I didn't give it to you. I. Well, I give it to 30 people that't use it. I'll give it to one, he's not using it so then I'll have to teach him how to use it and then we'll figure it out from there.al and bureaucr so I. I more technical who likes to coding and researching and something.  So I actually like to make sure that all of the fucking gene tickets are in the reg structure or Wiki pages areed correctly, so that we can find it information later. Why are you a archite? Because that's crazy talk for my chief architect to want to go do any of that for a lack of a word bullshit.  That's the bullshit that I deal with. Why do you wanna deal with it?.. I'm sorry.  You were in my position. Yeah, about 70 years ago, I was hired on that. I was the most because I had misavior.  That's Okay, what do you mean by that? Tell me more points. I tell you, I don't know how it was perceived by.  Okay, okay, I don't know if I want to go down. We we'll pause this. I'll remember that statement and come back to that over drinks or something..  Because I feel like I've itched on something I picked a scab or something. Okay. So, but does that mean you're not a chief architect?  Well, actually, there are never was any formal conversion to that role. I was actually once transferred into a chief engineer. Okay.  And then Sean just started using those two trans interchangeably, and then eventually, uh converted into just one of them. Cool. Let's stop talking like, I don't need your title.  Cool. I've assumed from your title. What's the job that you want to do and what's the job you think you are skilled out And maybe you're the same thing.  Maybe they're not.'s that's actually the question I asked on as well. So I really nicely go into details of things. Yeah.  So go to the recall, make sure know which cases are lost, things like that.. So that can be a code, the bugging, um, figuring out why something fails, whatever. Also, it may go into processes, like, why this thing is not followed or because it wasn't communicated or because it wasn't written correctly or used some, you know, terms of double meaning, whatever.  So I can go down that route. So that's a call itidingilities. capital. That's what I am good at.  Who has to have that trait with role of all of them? Developers definitely have to have it, and chief architects, probably also, um proters for sure. So I think it's a good trade to have for everyone..  Now, architecture, specifically. I like that shit. I like design big systems and making sure that it's actually cost efficient and um works well long term.  And obviously, I cannot like predict exact a lower that we will have in five years is ask Facebook. Did they predict billions of users? Probably not.  So yeah, architecture can change over time. That's why sometimes we can say that now architecture sucks, but it did not suck five years ago. How do you evaluate whether it did or didn't?  That's a good question. good that there are no metrics. Oh, like you say it's good and that's why I'm looking at you, I don't know that it's good. Yeah.  That's that's good. And and you said something that the reason I used for that. So why is chief architect you made sure that architecture sucks so that now we cannot support our ship.  Well, I like like the answer is, if your chief architect and all of these services don't follow a similar pattern, at a minimum, you suck it soft power. At a minimum you can't use your soft power. at a maximum maybe you can't architect either. But at a minimum, you couldn't get people to follow what you're doing, what you needed them to do., given the assumption that one of the thoughts and they either couldn't convey it or conveyed the wrong.  I'm assuming based on the title chief architect, but what you're telling me in the last ten minutes is that title doesn't mean shit. that title here at this company doesn't, it doesn't matter all. So I think um but we at least are gonna make it matter in my team, right? Yeah, fine and not we can change what those titles mean, because let me use him for a second, because we're not picking on you and I don't want to make you sure that you don't feel on picking on you.  CTO can mean multiple different things. Okay? It can mean the guy who's in charge of the product engineering organization.  It doesn't seem like that's going to be your role anymore or if it ever was. It also could mean the head technologist, like the place where the last, you know, what I would say is very few companies need a cheap architect and a CTO. If that CTO is a technology foc CTO and not a operator, like a VPN engineering.  And it sounds like I don't know, like it's not you you don't want to be a people manager and process guy. Yeah, I mean I don't think unnecessarily the most effective at that. And, you know, if you like, I can try to answer the same question for for you as well. from my view.  So, um, you know, as far as, you know, what I'm actually good at, I think, one of the things that I'm good at is writing in code, the um more uh specific specialty where I think I excel is um interactions between systems and, uh, thinking across systems boundaries, um you know, I I like to I like to see the big picture. If, uh, you know, if if a system is built out of six services, I want to run them all locally online machine and debug between all of them. um that's kind of how I play there. Um I also think I have a reasonably good um design and product insight, like I know the business pretty well.  I I know what we're doing pretty well. Like I could go from, you know a couple sentences from an executive of what we want to do and I could elaborate it into um something that really means something to engineers and be reasonably close to the mark most of the time. You know, there's probably a a couple of blind spots I have there, but you know, who doesn't?  Um I think I like both of those things. Um Both of those things are fun. Um, I think that uh uh but it's really hard to do both at the same time. like you can do one for a while and then the other completely falls into the weight side, you can do the other for a while and when you're doing that you're probably not fully coding, um but you said nothing about the process is nothing about opera like nothing about making the trains run on time, like that is somebody else, something else.  I don't think it's something that I'm good at. um and I don't think I bring any kind of unique value, except for maybe one thing. of like I do some of that out of necessity uh simply because I care enough. So, you know, if I know that we've got this deadline and this thing needs to get done, you know, I'll go hound the people, I'll go ask them for timelines, uh simply because, uh, you know, I find that deliberating that thing is important and, you know, if I see it's not getting done, then that's the slack that I'll pick up. Okay.  Now, you keep wanting to come back to talking about process, though. Okay? Is that what you want to be doing?  I'm not sure, because it involves fucking people. It's horrible. It's horrible.  Yeah, but I was doing that, and I think I like achieved something. I definitely won some bottles. I think What broke down then in the past 12 months?  Because like I'm looking at things now and everyone's telling me there was a before time. And whenever that time was, before things were better, but I'm looking at everything right now going, okay, uh, you hired a bunch of people. You fired a bunch of people, a bunch of people quit.  You're at least telling me people aren't following microservice pattern at a minimum code I've read my answer is, I actually think the code's a lot spaghetti all over the place that that even within repos, it it goes all over the place. But that's to be expected at a start. like So my answer is, it's going all the place. um Prowise, I can't. I don't I can't see any process.  It doesn't mean there's not. Yeah, I mean I think like if you're talking about the before time, it's exactly the hiring and firing that was probably one of the uh cheap reasons for casualties in process, uh like some of it was you know, I can't say that it was a much better before, but um like kind of what what happened, like when we brought in new product people, uh my view of what happened is that, you know, at the beginning of there were new in and they didn't didn't know how we did things before, um, then they kind of wanted to try to do things their way wanted to do it their own way, I'm gonna guess, too. Uh, probably, yeah.  Well, I I know, uh maybe the real root cause of all that. Okay. So, we have limited money, but we wanted top large people.  Yeah, only way you can do that is overseas and my so get I've spent a ton of time in Ukraine, Ukrainian engineers and Russian engineers are just as good as American engineers. The schools are just as good, the computer science programs are just as good, they're equivalent versus Central America, they're be students. They're there' be once.  They're fine for the right things, but you have just as good of engineers over there. And for a different price point. That's the reason why until recently we had developers only there..  And even the guys who are in Serbia now, they are Russians, they were re located to escape the war.. So not to fight, you know? I can tell you theact reason of theailer, we wanted to get people who walkily somewhere in Austin. for a cheap price, top north senior people. and I think the price that we actually used for, like, the top product people was not that global.  So I don't know that that's true or false right now. Here's what I know. Last week, Sean wanted to meet with me to talk about hiring.  So these we have a bunch of people interviews tomorrow. talk about hiring there. And I specifically pulled out the dotnet developers and I said, first of all, Austin's not a great dotnet town, doesn't mean there's notatnet developers, but that's not theanganca of this fucking town, okay? This is a Javacript Java.  If you really want to it's a Java town and a Java script town than it is at Dotcktown, g? One, two, I then asked him, what are you so first of all, what do you doing for seniority? Like what do you mean by senior?  And we all have different words for a senior, but let's say senior means at least eight years experience. Now, you have a different thing of to be senior, you have to do these things and you have these things and I have my own things, but let's just rule it them. Eight years experience, cool.  And then I said, how much? And the answer was 100 to 120. And I went, cool, I just got off the phone with my recruiter that I talked to and that answer is, one for to 160 without taking twice.  So, what's up? Do you guys? Listen, I wanna get your tongue alcohol and I wanna get your tongue alcohol, because it means you guys will be a little bit more innocent., yeah, yeah, sounds fine. and I'll.  Cool. Yeah, let me let me I got nothing else in my calendar on my calendar, so I had nothing. Not like that my car is not't even here yet because my car's in the shop So, the answer is yes.  Cool. yeah, where's the uh walking distance? There's only one real bar that uh Oyster bar.. You want to do that?  That's easy with me? Okay. on, that'll work for you? Yeah, fine.  Okay, what time do you wanna do that at? I'll look I mean, uh usually I wrap up between 5:30 and six, so. I have a spare. car?  Man, I didn't know. Can I come to do a spare cars, man? I didn't know that. of my hommer is not ready right now and uh I don't have any car here, no, I'm at the office..  I don't know, I'll message you. I mean, I can meet your car, but not. right now. you right next door, just do her over. well, uh yeah, it's that's fine. I wanted to also uh I mean I can give you a ride after we go to the bar if you want.  Fine, fine, fine, that's okay. No? No, I I wanted to do something like shopping, grocery, whatever. but yeah.  Hey, you can get that delivered, too. Yeah, I heard about that. Everything is doing.  Everything is delivered ly good, okay. I'll just so yes, last week when it was like, okay, what are you doing here? So I'm not sure that they're paid well.  I'm not. I don't know. I but if I had to bet based on my one interaction, my answer is, yeah, no, I bet we're bet we're underpaying everywhere.  Yeah, compared to what we want, probably, yes. Correct. correct. Like you can find like like talk to her about some of the people that are coming tomorrow.  I like that dead ops people for 100. Are you fucking kidding me? Dev off people print their own money.  The answer is 180 to 220 without thinking twice if there's any not America. they could be a a fresh out of a fresh out of college. Yeah, but he wants them here. Yeah.  People who are still on um F visa. uh who are studying. Th those are our guys. Yeah, that's but I'm told we want senior.  Yeah, this is the root cause. I told you. Well, listen.  So again, I can't fix the past, but what I can say is I can't put together a team that is in Austin, that you want me to have B plus an A minus players for pennies. Austin is a real market. Now you want me to do it overseas, that comes with a bunch of other problems, but those can be solved, but clearly you guys have had a wall like we can go down that path and say no Chad, let's fix the team overseas.  Cool we can go down the path that is the let's make a team here. Cool.. Well, there are a few things to that first one, uh let's say uh uh the overseas team lost the trust and their are actually several teams that one of them, the biggest one is Serbia, uh location wise. uh but there are also other guys who are working from uh, like Madagascar, Spain, some of other places. those are digital nom ones like we don't care about them, that's okay, they they don't pay taxes most probably.  We don't care. But people in survey, for some reason, we care about and they also now will cost us twice as much because they discovered that they went above the threshold and they have to pay different tax right now. which doubles uh employer tax.. And uh they they say uh compensate.  And Sean says fuck you. So, uh that we will probably lose old serving, okay? At least they talk guys.  Kack is uh. if there are people you we can't are there some of them that we can't afford to lose? We already lost those guys. Oh.  So so all we're losing there are that I think we need to be able to hold on to, but uh it's also true that a lot of the people we've lost already. You know, we like any one of us could, you know, go through the roster and be able to say at least something about people. or say I don't know, which also means something. Yeah, okay. but uh no, let me just quickly go into the second thing.  I'm leaving myself out no, so keep going, but I was I didn't what you think I'm texting, I'm actually giving myself a reminder. Uh, okay, cool. because we wanted to have top noise for a lower buck, we started to jump through the hooks. and and what happened? well, first here is the number.  Uh when we started hiring those senior product people, uh we got one cool candidate and uh she said 130 and she's, that's too much. I think, for seeing her a product, it's not way too much. It's nowhere close to enough.  Yes, he says way too much, so, um let's try to convert that to maybe hundred something plus stocks. Okay. Uh, didn't work out.  So we went to other candidates. And we found those three, now only John is left, but before it was also a log in Tiago, and what was promised to them is lowish salery plus some stocks, plus uh cool title.ago went with director of product and engineering title. He still has it on his, John was a less uh, yeah, but uh no, they were all like same level.  Yeah, his title he chose was principal. could be, could be. Only reason I know that is cause again, that means something to me and John's responses to me over the last two weeks I've been like, dude, I mean, how on your boss, really? Yeah, but uh, what they ever promised, is like a cool titles, uh, some stock in exchange for a low. but with the cool title also comes an expectation.  So AS said, I am the top of the top of the top do we expect me to do hands on work? Fuck you. I will be writing requirements.  No way. Yeah, well I am above that. Yeah, I got it.  That is the root cause. So the the good news is is I will fix this quickly. Like literally in my first 30 days we will shake out the people who want to work and want to do the things we need them to do or don't.  Now, yes, I won't be able to figure and fix all the comp proud. I won't to fix all the problems. But the people that are like, hey, no, I'm a principal and I don't write stories.  My answer is, hey, cool, suck my dick. Like, we don't have time for that anymore guys. So cool.  So, not gonna happen. But I'll get get there with them. The answer is I gotta give him an opportunity, and by the way, no one's gonna look at me and say no, because everybody wants a job and nobody wants to be looking for a job right now.  Doesn't mean they can do it, doesn't mean I won't let them go. It does mean, though, that I'm going to be clear about what my expectations are. and we're going to start small and we're going to build up. So we starting with this one guy for an STM because I have expectations for an STM, like to me, there's the way I've been running my team for the last four years different.  Here's the way I usually run my teams. Every team has a triumant leadership. It has a engineering manager.  It has a product manager and has a tech lead. And there's three different ones because my engineering manager, the SDM, your job is just scrum management, your job is just making sure that things run on time. Your job is just people management.  I need you to be technical enough because if you' managing an engineer and they say sequel to you and you can't like speak the same language in engineer, the engineers will not deal. Right. So you have to be technical.  But you're not someone who''s in charge of the technical code base. That's your tech lead. That's an engineer. way of looking at that so I think if we have this single person who is deciding on things, it will completely wipe out any responsibilities from developers.  What do you mean was so are you saying what you want or what you have now? My interpretation of that statement is that's why, um we don't have tech leads now because my belief is that if we didn't have them, somehow the rest ofition becomes more responsible. So you so sorry.  You would like to argue with me, which is fine. Do not trust anything I fucking say, let's argue, I'll debate all day. You'd like to argue that that's the best way to do things.  Cool. I'm not doing anything right now. So the good news is I'm telling you my bias.  I'm not telling you I have no plans here. None. My bias is that.  By the way, I tend to more agree with you. I have been running my teams with two leaders for the last four years, not three. but only because I've been running small teams, a bunch of small teams doing very specific things, but I tend to agree with you. The answer is I want to diffuse ownership as much as possible.  I need someone who is in charge of what do I build and communicating that to engineering in a useful way? I do need someone whose job it is to keep the trains to run on time. It can be that other person.  But I want that person talking to their customers a lot. And that's where it's usually it's why I still split up., since we hired me, it seems like we've lost a lot of people since we've hired me. Yeah, hired for four weeks..  Okay. So uh we kind of have the same uh uh trilogy, let's call it this way. So we have this scrus slash technical uh manager, because that's like a lowest level of technical manager on team who has to cut the craft on the lowest level, example of daily codes or playing codes, things like that.  Then we have the product same stuff, and then we have this SDM. We don't have SDM for all teams, but for two we do, and this SDM actually has to be the lead who doesn't code. but also has to be the lead who it's called a scrum lead. If you if you uh look at like a LincIn course about the scrum architect and scrrum leadership, uh there it says, it should not be the guy who says, do it my way, it has to be the guy who grows professionals.  And rather engages with conversation, brainstorming, things like that, so that the team grows and they all become leaders. They all become technical professionals. So that has to be the guy who makes sure that the conversations are still steeled in the right way.  Nothing is lost, but not in the way. I told you, why didn't you go through this corner case? but rather, hey, are there any other corner cases?  Yeah, maybe, maybe somewhere in that area and they say oh yeah, we forgot this. Yeah, right. So they have to come up with that, not he tell them you stupid.  So, that's get the role of is young. So, yeah, it's technically an elite, and and later on I actually lean towards calling them leads, but that's again, uh a hiring trick, because if we get SDMs, they think that they are top notch and they have to do nothing here. Just receive salary and smoke cigars that that's the only thing the title gives you.  But we said, okay, let's hire technical leads, they will be with less experience and less ego and let them do the same thing as we said. But they will not code. Yep.  So, there's a thing that I need from each of you. Could be one document, maybe it's two. Okay?  Who are the people left on this team that we can't afford to lose and why they have the skill they have that skill, whatever it is who are the people that we have left that we couldn't afford to lose, what we did, and for what reason, this skill, that skill? don't I can't email it to me?, I don't think I understood the distinction between the two things is still here? Who is not?  Okay, so so the people who've lost that we were important and who still because does it mean we can't go back and get those people or some of those people? We couldn't try to go get it if we needed to. Because I'm looking at things going, uh, you seem like me and you seem like we have a similar problem.  We're both binary, black and white, A or B. It's hard for us to see shades of gray. That's my take on you right now. You are a strong point of view, A's or B's.  I'm also a strong point of you A's or Bs. There isn't in between. You have to war I have to work at that.  Seems like the sky is falling at this and oh my God, there's by the end of the year, there's nobody left and we're fucked. right the code by itself, but we'll block in a eye to that and it will be like a service system. Seems like you're in that camp that thinks that. Yeah, yeah.  I think we we lost two cool guys. Ivan, umikit and we are about to lose I the third one. uh he will leave in a month. uh Is he has he already quit? Is he I am in the process of convincing him to stay, but probably he will leave.  Okay. after that, um we may have like a few more cool developers, but it's what, like, maybe two? Okay, what was his name again? what?  Ivan.. I just I wish this fucking TV was working. I wanna look at something they doing something.  Go go to teams and just start typing. Oh, you want to. I want a spot on it.  I wanna see what he is.. Oh. Not my percentage. by the more your car..  Ah, this is right.. yellow.. It. Anz, right?  Yeah.. I I'll go right back the wall. Cool. 
who knows? And he actually was fighting with guys at a lot. And that's the reason why he leaves actually He's not somebody who's clearly and look at you go in you're crazy.  I don't the data doesn't tell me you're crazy. The data goes, huh, I was hoping you were giving me somebody that was that was clearly an outlier. No, he's not.  He's clearly right in the middle and I would expect if he's the most important that there developers who don't have a lot of code, I don't know what they do. So like if you're a developer, your currency of the realm is code. doesn't mean it's always doesn't mean it's it just means I should see a lot of commitsment developer like if I have more commits from you in the last six months, that's a problem. And I have a lot of commits in the last six months, but that I was doing a lot of development.  So Okay. So you're you're going to send me P and the things he has, you're going to send me and anybody else. Because it looks to me like the first thing I have to do when I told you what my number one number two, I got to stop the most important people from walking out that door because it seems like right now everyone's walking out the door..  So I need you guys to give me a list of who those people are, but then I also want you to give me the list of who already walked out and that are who are the except I don't not everybody who are the exceptional ones, because maybe we can go get one or two of them back, depending on what else is going on. Yeah. it's maybe possible because uh the honeymoon, uh period will be over at their new place and they will discover that shit is everywhere. and they actually are already doing that. So wait, you can get on that.  But we can't until we actually also have something that becoming a back that's good. Here is what's back but but at least gives me a a a hit list stuff. Hey, let's try to figure out how to keep how to how to meet these people..  Okay. okay. Actually, let's go back a little bit to um the comment I need on the proxy comment. You remember that?  Yeah. So um actually, I was talking not about the jellyfish. I was talking about something else.  Okay. Uh so um Sean caught it your observations to me, um yeah. I the same thing.  Yeah, but that was about something else. Uh when you observed how people react to the school earth reason issue, you wrote from something, Well, I think actually later on I found some of that same like text in your other message, so maybe it was not only about the cover thing, but Sean gave it to me that context. So, like, you observed how people react on the production shoot and uh you found out that there is no leadership.  And I was skeptical a bit about that and I said Sean that, uh we actually need to uh dive deeper at least, uh into the context before we can say. um that was my con and and my maybe it was delivered to you, maybe not, but uh I meant that. why I think that uh they're actually is leadership. Play some sort. leadership comes in different shapes. I think developers are maybe they don't code much or whatever, but they uh care.  They do care, if there is a problem they will stay late, I know 3 a. uh disregarding their family, working hours, whatever, they will jump to other systems, they never tried before. they go this last mile. They do this. If they didn't care, they imagine what would they do.  So let me try repeating that back to you with different words to see if I'm agreeing with you. They will put in the effort if asked to, and not only that, they will do like effort. They will do more work. doesn't mean they're doing the right stuff, but they will do stuff..  Now, is that what you're saying? Uh, more or less, but sometimes they are self engaged. They they may show the initiative.  They may start us answering support right away without anyone pinging them before they come. But they don't always because they have work.reme tickets, they have them, they still work on them. And then for the toner comes and tells them,ey, look at this and maybe then later in there, but it will be seen by people outside of the thread, uh, it will be seen like, uh, they didn't engage into someone else them.  But I think in general they care. Maybe they stop caring after they've done like the first thing. Like they they put the fire down and they don't by their own uh, like uh intent, they don't go back to this.  They don't do this long-term solution. That's why we need leaders on top of them to remind them about this. So I don't believe I've ever told anybody or think that people don't care.  Yeah, well, I I know translated that in my head, I guess. because when you say uh, there are no leadership anywhere, you there's an absence of leadership.. yeah. So, uh, if we look at different roles, they uh show the leadership differently. Cool.  Let me, make sure I'ar. um a company of developers is useless. So I don't give a shit if a bunch of developers are good leaders. If you're not figuring out the right product to go build and taking care of your customers, I don't like so cool, you have a bunch of great developers that don't know what to build and aren't prioritized correctly.  Who cares? I mean, good job. You have a great you have a bunch of developers at uh who cares?  And that's okay. That's why I'm like, yeah, I don't know whether they are good leaders or not. and when I say leaders, I'm actually meaning the people that have the titles they have right now. Sorry, and John, because John says he's a principal product manager.  Okay. But I expect that you and you and me and John, because he's a principal product manager, that's different. We're the leaders.  Everybody else may have some leadership skills they have to go like like your def manager. I forgot his name already. Like, I expect there to be a level of leadership, but it's in this little bucket that he goes and does it at.  My expectation is, John and you and you and me. I'm probably missing a couple of other people, but these are the leaders for the like who are making sure that the team is working on the right thing. As of two weeks ago, I'm not convinced anybody..  I would agree with this. So that's what I mean by leadership. That doesn't mean there's not a good leader who's an engineer, that's a leader as an engineer.  Cool. I just don't know to do with that right now, because the really answer is there's nobody on the team that's saying, hey folks, this is how we work. This is what we're working on.  Let's make sure you all understand that and let me tell that to you guys 500 times because I have to keep saying the same thing over and over again because that's what leadership mostly is is saying the same thing over and over again. actually, yeah, that's an interesting thing because we do that. We do that. Well, but in a specific way.  I think there is like a zero people management across the company. But somehow we still give feedback, and that is on demand in the context of current situation. So sometimes there are some uh like conversations out of the context that just in general, hey, what, uh, uh this role should do?  And we go and we write a document, uh technical requirements for a role or score card of a roll or keep the eyes for a roll. So and that we think globally. But in most cases, what we do is we are in the current situation in the moment, and we realize that in this moment, uh those are the fuck ups and we tell responsible people don't do those fuck ups anymore.  That's the way we do feedback. On regular one on one, which will happen a week after this incident, we will forget all the previous fuckups. Maybe we will remember the last one that happened a week ago, but uh all the ones that happened the before that we forget.  How were the team retrospectives right now? Oh yeah, that's is another conversation they happen. The teams are not happy with how they happen. so several problems.  First of all, uh, no one until recently understood what the fucking retrospective is, even after a bunch of certification trainings and discussions. So, and they were blindsided by freaking tools like, uh M or Jira whiteboard or that. They have templates..  But those templates, they bias towards doing things that way, and that is the wrong way. You don't do you don't bring in tools until you have processing. Yeah.  And and what they because all of those tools, they say, oh, what do we have done in the right was we have done wrong, what we should keep doing, whatever. And people just feel those columns with their sticky nose, and that's it, boom, the retrospective done. No, not done.  You haven't asked why you failed this print, you haven't uh asked why you failed all the estimations that you provided. You haven't provided any corrective actions. What's the goal of the retrospective?  I have to ask who are doing that right now. Okay. They are strongusters right now.  And that's different than an SDM. Yeah. So I have SDMs and I have scrum masters. scrum master does several things.  First, it was a people manager before SDMs appeared. What what do they do now? I think they probably still do that to a degree when it comes to, you know, the day to day work like hey, can you please uh, you know, review these tickets that are waiting on review?  you know, like that type of people, maybe because he's more technical, but I would say yes. It's it's part of that. So basically they they speed up uh things, uh and and sometimes that's where I don't like the numbers because don't think that I' always saying the person great product people suck.  No, sometimes the also suck. When they they have a request. I if you use gu card before pool request.  So, uh and it's just there. And they are not informing anyone about this merch request. and the first, where is your fucking merchest? Was it merged?  And they said, it's it's it's not there. I am done with my part. I wrote emer request, and it clearly says that it's in the Peging review state and I move my insurance ticket to pending review, no one looked at all of the pending reviews. don't understand that their job is to get their tickets into production. yeah, there like the company or whatever, so they just stop at their thing.  Okay, let's go back to this. Second thing is um uh we call it releasesases, but um uh it's not everything related to releases. because there are technical things related to releases like, how do we merge? How do we uh uh chariokee if there are problems and so on like technical things are handled by developers, but that is more about cross team communication.  Because as I said, no one fucking owns a single repository at the moment, everyone leaves only in their features. They have a feature and it's um some somehow has to be released, it goes into reportatory a, also in another team has committed in that same reporitory, let's look at all of the tickets that are now paying released. Those are ours, those are not ours, let's check, those ones can we release them right now, or we should move that aside and all release that, and that will be released later.  So that this scr strongaster does this, the inventory of the things paining the release. And sometimes they do it, but most cases they forgot about that, uh, but they know they should be doing that. first thing is actual sc strong Mustang, because we don't call them strong musts. we call them project managers. Uh, so scramus is fully facilitating all of these stramatages.  They will called uh planings, retrospectives, all of that stuff. If you have a team of of a hundred people. how many of and you run product engineering? What percentage of the developers and what percentage are everything else?  Perfection, like your your thought. Well, well, typically the strong team is wife to nine, which is seven plus minus to and so let's take seven and obviously, hundred people is not on, but b build it from build it this way? That's fine.  Yeah, but it's not strongay, because from only talks about that. cool, if there is another team and there is some sort of communication from breaks here, and it requires something else that's safe or some other framework. abortion, but I understand what you're saying. So, it's hard to say what level of, um, like extra management you need to make sure those. It's not hard to say, uh, everything else everybody that's not a developer is a tax.  At the end of the day, perfection is developers, right? Like everyone's a developer and developers are talking to everybody and they're writing code because if you can't write code, but I get it, we have to put people around people that write code. So if you had your what's perfection, what percentage of people would be developers and what percentage would be QA, scrub master, product, whatever?, if you ask Netflix, they say zero over.  It's marketing. It's. But let's say it's only like one or two layers on top. and maybe I two3 so that would be well, let's say eight would be the medium so it will be 10 per team.  So it's like ten people like that. out of a hundred people, it would be 20, so 20%. Okay, 20%. What's ours?  Ours, some teams have five managers., but we count off the total number of developers, total number of manag, what is I believe there's 22 developers, and I believe I have 40 to 45 people on my team. designers who knows where to? Hold on. Let me ask the robot..  No mail this., too many words. I can't fuck in print track it up there. So you know, you gonna say summarize that in a single sentence.  Yeah, but I don't want to summarize I want it to be yeah. This is what I think the team looks like, based on the subs been getting. Okay, okay, um No, he is Pav with that Okay, okay.  What is this gigron? it's gigran.. Yeah, okay, okay.  So, how many are That is cost slow today. what is in my head. Yeah. I fucking we did chat.. 13 to 15. was it cannot be 13. now the left or what?  Because I don't I don't have an initial list. All I have is the things that I was sent to head time. Okay.  So, if you if you look at this freaking bureaucracy overheaded I've been dealing with, I was trying to do exactly that. Yeah. build thease and see who is which team or whatever. All of that stocks says I am the only one who is trying to push that.  As soon as I stop doing that, everyone says, I don't mean it. Yeah, I've, no, like the information that I asked for that I wasn't provided, or I provided partially. I was like, cool.  Now that just tells me what I have. And that is, I have a bunch of people doing stuff. Cool, I know figure out what stuff is useful.  I gotta go figure out who can do stuff I care about. and that's where I'm at. It's like, okay, but I believe about 50% of my team aren't developers. And while I'm like, wow, yeah, that's a that's a lot of cost for it it may look like that.  It may look like that. I mean, you said it may look like that, but the answer is you you just said it, you had your, you know, perfection would be a 20% tax. So, anything over 20%, the answer is we at leastree is there's probably some waste.  And at that number approaches 50%, now I think to being, you would both go. That was a lot of waste. Well, what way more on toic until over those guys laugh..  So, now now we don't have sunat in Tiago, a log someone someone else as well probably I saw. For for product people have uh, but um maybe this answer is wrong, because you said developers, and where uh QA people go, where you design not developer. Those are just taxes, man.  The worker the people who build the shit, everything else around them, like if I don't have people to build the shit, I don't need you. If I have half as many people to build the shit, I need half as many as you., that's that And that's why it's all not like, listen, nobody likes being called attack, but like literally, I have the definition of overhead. Like, that's 100% percent overhead.  And the answer is, I need people to partner with my developers because my developers aren't great at everything. So I need there to be this tax. But at the end of the day, I need there to be the proper amount of tax and a grid.  I and you are perfection 20%, 30% percent unlike, okay, cool, 50% my answer is something's wild and out of whack right now.. Yeah. I I covered that in my document in the sent you.  I I think we, uh uh have really uh strange uh structure. Yes,reme. Oh, great.  It we're gonna sim we have to simplify it. A, we need to. B, people need to understand their job.  I need you to come in every day and do A, B and C. What about Z? I don't care about Z. I need you to do A B and C. and we gotta make sure we have the right things then and maybe that means things are gonna fall through the cracks and I'm gonna have to go to Sean and say, hey, based up where we're at, we can doABC and D Pick three.  You can't pick four. Chad, I want you to do four. I'm not a mir worker man. you can you can fire me right now because I can do what I can't go do.  I can't promise you and I'm not going to promise you that I can go do other things. But I know I am not underpaid. I'm not overpaid, and I'm at the lower end of what you get in Austin for my job, but if John has at least a habit of I underpay everybody, cool, he didn't do that to me. now again, when I picked at it with Sean, I was like, hey, uh, you want these dotnet developers and he's giving me this ridiculous number and I like I I nicely laughed at him and said, uh, you know like I there's no way I can go higher for that.  So we're going to have to rethink how we do things. But he's I've at least broken his cherry of he's not thinking he can go higher everybody cheap and for nothing. So and a lot of that is just kind of like legacy, that's how we used to operate so it's.  He didn't do it to me. Yes. So so we have we have at least some evidence of us trying to arrange that correct been trying to change that this year how successful it is so far These are our current ones?  Those are kind oh my God. So we are below that, for sure, right now, but those are the references for the local hires. Because if you look at a full stat in Jerbia, they are paid less.  But for local hires in Canada and the US, that's what we talking about. about a third of my team was in Atlanta. Atlanta is not a top market. Austin is a tier two city, der one.  We're not San Francisco. It's a tier 2 city. Atlanta is not even a Tier 3 city.  Like it's okay. um I had four junior people who none of them had college degrees in computer science, all of them learned a cod at a boot camp academy, all of them it was their first professional coding job. Some people were a manager at a restaurant beforehand, some people this was their first job. Okay, so I'm giving you what they are.  They all made a minimum of $120,000 a year with me. Okay. So uh go talk to Shan, I told him this already.  I told him, cause I absolutely unrealistic. yeah, agree. These numbers are not realistic. I can't now.  This doesn't mean that we have that money. It doesn't mean get it. I have to go figure out okay, well cool, what's my thing?  Where we have to go do? cool, here's what I can go do with that amount of money with a day. So, like it's not I can look at my boss and go, you can't do that.  It's hey, okay, cool, uh, I have a limit of this. I limited this. But I can also tell you that in my interview, I asked him one question very specifically, hey, if I needed to go up and headst two to four people in the short term so that way I could bring people in, go figure out what I needed to go do, but people that I know I can go trust. do I have the ability to go do that?  His answer was, no, you actually spend too much in product engineering right now. Not only that your costs in terms of your product are way above where they need to be.? Because he thinks developers areux.  Okay. Guess guess what? They all think that.  They don't give a fuck about what we do, guys. They don't care on it at all. He's not he's not special there.  Like the answer is no, they need the money making machine to work and they don't wanna think about how the money making machine works. salesartment. Correct. We're across center.  100%. Now a week later, we are talking and he told me, Chad, I think you're gonna have to bring the product team here in in America and I think you're gonna have to do that sooner rather than later. Explain to me that.  Why why did this change already? Then last week he told me the same thing about engineering. Yeah, he doesn't trust.. fine.  I can just say something. Charles says things after he got a conversation with someone. Yes.  It's not a really thought true thing. Yeah, he's not looking at code. He's not looking at jelly.  He's not looking at things. He just sees what he sees is, I have customers yelling at me and I look at this and this in and I don't know when they're going to release like he only sees it again, it's not is he not he's not unique there. Like that's like every boss. and it there's more than visibility.  I think the other thing about it is, you know, there's obvious reasons for kind of like local in-house for teams that we don't really need to rehash. Like things like, you know, actually instilling culture, things like getting someone to actually look at this thing right now when I want them to look at it right now. They're all vastly simpler.  When you're in person at the office. I, if you could from day one build a team from scratch, would you build it 100% overseas or would you do something besides build it 100% oversight?. No way, right Because of the culture and where are my customers and be as close to my customers?  you' build it something different. I would have 66% of my team here this in here,irty3% of my team off short. Well,reed.  Good point. The answer is we're talking about these perfect, just like the 8020, we're only just talking about perfection. Cool.  But there's many reasons why we probably wanna have more people here. now, mostly those reasons our reaction to some bad things happening. But some of those bad things are also like there's no ability to influence the culture. Like, I mean, again, like the big story about all of these microservices that they're not fucking redoing anything, that'd be easier if they were all sitting here.  You still need leadership, you still need all that other stuff. No, I'm not sure. I am actually not sure.  So uh we have one developer there, maybe Ricardo you don't need just one. You need eight you need to center our phone. So listen.  I don't have an ex I don't have history. If I tell my developers to do something and I give them the tools to do it, I don't have a history of them that not doing it. Now, one Tuesday they may not one Tuesday me I may fire them, but the answer is if I tell everybody, here's my expectation, here's how you're going to be evaluated, they will do it or they will get off the bus.  I'm not worried about that part. You seem to be worried about that. I am in the micros.  Cool, but I mean, but the technology, the business problems, the technology only makes them worse. At the end of the day, you can't solve the business problems with technology. And part of the business problems is I can't give somebody, what do we have to get built by February 15?  The fact that I still don't have that fucking list is insane. That's not a technology problem. That's not a microsoface problem.  But yes, I like I'm sure there I'm sure you are very embarrassed of your ugly baby, so am I. I like let me walk you through all of my histories of all of my ugly babies. They're all ugly and they're all horrible. Yes.  Yeah, well, back then it sounded okay. There you made the right decisions based on the information at the time. Yeah, and and things changed.  Yeah, we haven't really learned. So, yeah, this thing doesn't work that it. That didn't happen.  So somewhere, maybe three years ago, we should have learned, and we should have fixed something. Next best time today. Yeah, I But that, like what happens if we miss February 15th?  I have no idea. We already be so many big things, so hard to say, but uh obviously, we can be nice. But I don't even know what we are missing.  I'm gonna go get like I also don't know what the answers are. I will have to get in or twwined, but here's what I will tell everybody. We will have deadlines and we will hit deadlines.  And if a deadline has a meaning, it will have a meaning and we will all know it. And we will be hitting this deadline because it means something. And if we miss it, it will be a big deal that we missed it.  I'm of the assumption that missing February 15 that we got a repri from January 15th of February 15th because they're not ready. Great. We will use every second of that, but it's also pretty fucking core to the company that we hit this because that's our growth plans of how we're going to grow is this way.  I am not hard some compan just because a very similar thing happened to years ago.. Exactly two years ago when Klover just became a thing.. It was not, two years ago.  We uh went through the review of the things that we are missing for a clover. It was back then tablet clover, not mobile clover that they have and the woman's like smaller devices. But um uh we went through the set that process, the infrastructure provisioning, uh then all of the screens that have to be ported to look nice and clover.  Also there is no like file upload of any store, because nowhere to insert the the flash card. so uh some limitation to that, uh and like use the BOC, we went through like would that be easy to use the system there. and we built some plan of how what has to be fix the plan was a tremend like a hundred more plus items. And um the plan is still there. I don't think we are even in the cough through, uh but everyone stopped treking.  We only focused maybe on top things, and they were somehow done, uh January 8h or so or beginning of January was a deadline and we hit that with like sweat and tears out of your ass. Like we were able to deliver this thing and then half a year go, nothing changes, zero clover devices added. And then Sean says, well, obviously, this thing was not ready, so why would we engage with sales team?  But internally, all of the development stopped and we repayoritize them other things. So, again, the sins of the past I can't do anything about, and I still don't understand everything that's going on. Maybe you guys can help me with a math exercise.  Let's do a math exercise.. How many users do you have? depends on how you count users we counted typically by locations, and I'd say ballpark of like, uh 25 to 200. cool.  I say that I can use it. Yeah, okay. What's the monthly cost?  Um between one let's call it 175. What a a person? I wasn't cool. where user cost?  Well, like we really count by locations, so should I start with the number of locations? 25 is the average location? Oh, that'sations that is location.  Because you may have a price that was. And then a location is 175. yes. that number? Oh, you have that or something?  Well, let's see here about five by 175, that's uh well, 437,000. I'm it. Yeah, cool.  That's the revenue from this, right? Cool. I believe the cost of just the head count on this team is about 3 to 3.5.  We're actual fix some numbers somewhere are your numbers monthly or yearly?ly? Well, that's monthly.  This is monthly, yes, multiply by 12. Go great. Which is uh 5.6 six six million.  Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, six point.  Yeah. So, three something, I believe is the cost about three to make it crazy.? I I can find it.  Okay, that's just endge product in hearing, and that's not the hard that's not the hosting costs. That's just head, okay? Engineering is about half the company, product engineering, but half the company.  So let's just say that the other half of the company is roughly three, not gonna be correct.. Okay. Well, I think it was like 70% engineering.  Oh, yeah, it's shifting now, right, it shifted, and so when I was asked, okay, so another three. Cool. All right.  So we're on car.reed. So, I didn't come here to work at a company that treads water. now, I my answer is cool. So I don't right now I can't judge Shawn and the board and how they do.  Now, you can't, and it's fair and I'm listening to every you are saying about this company and internalizing it, because while I don't know necessarily agree that you are correct, I agree it's a point of view that has some validity. Now, I'll figure out along the way we're correctness is, okay? But high level math, our answer is, okay, well, we need to be doing way, way more than that, because I want to see a 10 X investment on my developers.  Like, we're bringing in at least 10 X. This is insanity that we're bringing in o. Now, cool. That's the past.  Don't care about the past, it's about how we go forward and let's make it stop. And so I'm not sure that what he's saying is correct, but is thesis to be is Pfizer plus PNC is the growth engine for the future? We've never really had a growth engine.  It's been word of mouth. Our bet is the growth engines. We need to start small with them, hit, and then the sky's a limit.  Now, I don't believe any CEO founder when they tell me fucking shit. The answer is they're all selling at some point. So whether or not that's a like don't know. but he and he sees the same thing of like, I'm spending all the money that I'm making every year.  Yeah, three meal it was uh no. maybe two years ago, but you forgot, yeah. This is a essentially like our historic strategy in terms of just like revenue it growth has always been like, okay, pretty much reinvest everything, so we've been very close to break even pretty much the entire time has been been. you still basically are. Yes, and we still basically are.  So it's still the space even thing. And when I like the thing that frecked me out with a cup, I like,, you've never done a real race. Like, it was friends and family of how you guys started the company. and then last year, since 18 months ago, he went and get a a big he did a safe, but did a board round where it's not a real round, it said, you put it money. you know, and that and he says that gets us another like 18 months of bas this.  But that's why he's hiring me, I think is, hey Chap, we need to change this curve. and you're like, okay, uh, yeah, but I don't believe that. I can't say I don't I believe it neither. Do you have a better idea of how they're gonna go bring in 10 X the revenue?  Well uh more smaller clients so retargeting. So higher sales team? So let's go down because my answer is, I don't know shit about how to grow a business.  I know a lot about how to run a product and engineering team and definitely on engineering team product is my second yearary thing. I'm an engineer. But I don't know shit about how to fucking go to market and how to go find customers.  I don't know any shit about that. You know more about that than I do? Okay, so so so so now, maybe you think they're a whole bunch of idiots over there figuring out how I don't know that.  But we don't know that. We can't play that game. We didn't have sales a company.reed.  We don't we do it was just mostly and we have thatlover and we will finally have this even like a bigger sales force working on behalf of us. So that's where we will get all of those uh canx and maybe even more.. But only if we go build a bunch of shit for them that makes it so that we fit that they are fucking product strategy.  Yeah, but I think we lie to ourselves when we say we know what is this that they need. I don't disagree with you here either, because I while I sure that no human being at this company can articulate for me what we need to go build, I'm also almost as sure that no human being I trust has actually riddled that list down to Here is the things we need to do and the wise. Now, I'm not saying we're far away from that.  I'm just saying, no one can talk to me. Yeah, yeah, and I think we we actually have like last time we we sat down and did like a product and priorization discussion. I I feel like we were close, but but it's always kind of uh I'd say it's just always just a little bit shy of actually capturing all the information.  Yeah because uh like between the the people sitting in the room, like, oh, we knew the's, but we wouldn't write down the whys. We just wrote down, okay, this one's the last habit. This one's the nice to have.  Yeah. Yeah, and yeah, if you sit it down and be like, why is this one the most have? We'll give some kind of answer. it's not the thing we need to get to is maybe we can get all of that done.  I don't know any I've seen what I've seen of a list and I don't know what it means on the inside for sure, but I'm old and I've seen enough of those things. So like uh internationalization, you're not doing that in time. If you already don't have all your shit in fucking bundles and you already don't know how it is you're going to translate that and have that built in your pikeeline, you're not going to get that done by January.  If you have zero done, you guys have something more than zero done. But like that one, very, very big. There's quite a few of them that I was like, that seems really big.  That seems really big. I highly convinced that I'm gonna be going to my boss in the next two to four weeks saying, cool, here's the big list. That's 12 man.  That's 12 months worth of work. Now let me help you prioritize what we can do. That's my guess of what sometime in the next 30 days is gonna look like what we need in Sean. of me going, here's the flash of water on your face.  It's actually worse than you think it is. Now let me tell you how bad it is, then let's figure out how what's the best we can go do and how we make that the best thing in the company. But I can't do that until I actually get down to the bottoms and what everything is.  No, and well, I can tell you that from me, like pretty much anything in any list that's just a one sentence subscription, I could tell you about it. Yeah. Why isn't there a bunch of geotickets?  Why is it how many ge tickets are tabbed with PNC? And is that the correct number of ge tickets? Um I think it's actually decently close of that's actually exactly what we were doing last time we were prioritizing.  There was there's a couple labels for the high levelvel tickets, that be used at the whole PNC is the label I needed care of. Yes, that is the label, you need to care about the like there's there's essentially a couple of sublabels and maybe there there's like a couple of places where like a sublabel came in there in the past two weeks, how much work do you think on the teen should be doing on tickets that are labeled PNC? What percentage of the development time?  Do you think in the last two weeks they should have been putting on things that are on that list? Um, should be a 100. No, it shouldn't because this workload team does not work on BNC and they're part of the development team.  And, um I excludedlips team in but are you excluding Sp sportclips team? I I think we have to get get down to the right thing, because, like these things unsaid is how we confuse ourselves.s and almost half uh yeah, I think it should be like like between 40 and fif percent. Yeah.  And even then if we exclude Spark, it would not be 100% percent.. they are finishing things from the past.. Clover stuff. Where would that have gone?  well, uh PNC and clover are so overlapped that they could be considered the same thing. Okay. essentially, um and and strategically were focusing on some of on a lot of the things that are both. So there are some things that are PNC specific, but there's a lot more that's really this benefits both PNC and clover.  But if there was an operation this issue last week or the week before, that, while it may need to get done with PNC, means that's more work that's on the PNC stuff, because there's a bunch of old operat there's a bunch of old bullshit that we have to fix. Yes. That may not that at least in those bugs wasn't captured in, we have to go fix these things.  Right. that would like the idea that we have to broken stuff would not have been in any of the high level plans.. Like you so for instance, if you guys had already agreed to do the platri platforming thing, that could have been on that list that we've already agreed we're gonna go do this thing.. So we hold on a way. fish.  That's back here... Uh-huh.., and which has what nature nate and, why don't we do this? We're gonna probably leaving in an hour.  I wanna get some things done and get in line with in jellyfish now that I know some sort of stuff. Anything else we should cover right this second, because I'm gonna be here all week. You're gonna be here all week, three.  Cool. Yeah, um I think I don't have anything unless you specifically need something for me, uh, like, I will be just as happy to go right some more code. Okay. sorry.  Uh, well, I I need an answer on this par. Oh, well, uh why exactly is it that you feel like you need a natural? earlier, we start doing sound there, uh the easier for us, so we change squareules to round.  Okay. then I'm gonna have to counter and say that um, what you need is not an answer on eragon, what you need is to spend time with me on architecture of Quinics and the upcoming paral integration so that you can actually answer on how much heodon's going to help us. Okay, let's go discuss that. Or do you want to call Swift?  I mean up I'm so close to actually seeing that thing that once. Okay, I can discuss architecture if you want fine either way. Thank you, gentlemen.  I'm gonna look at some stuff. Uh, one, uh one comment. next time before the racing, can you take a picture? I picture perfect., because I I would need know, look at the quicker,..  No. I. I's still where it today Some hours and killer back. by the sister from. Yes. cool.  Uh, I spoke with Laura. made probably gonna book someone to read this TV and get you the new one, which is called. Okay. So that be fix and whatever this is, I'ope.  There is no landport or whatever expect. Yeah, it's only there, but it doesn't make any sense. I can there is a a a a myar connection. like there's a wire that was hanging out behind.  It's underneath it right now. There is an et Internet cable right here.. It's even that.  And I'm pretty sure it's okay or I'm sure that's on this can go wireless. Okay. go whatever that isrolling this camera cannot. I've seen it in the other offices, so we'll figure around that one.  But do you need a camera for I will bring in my own camera. I have a great camera for it., we can buy whatever, just to Laura. I have a bunch of stuff that goes with me with different like like like I have a my keyboard I'll get and everything, so.  Yep. yeah, I have my own things. like cold. I's. I like I don't like that, yeah, when you see mine, you'll know why I have my keyboard.  I don't know if I can make it work fast or not, but we be around happens to just move this stuff. Go. and I'll help as much as I can about the IT, but I don't. Thank you.  No problem. I'll put this back when I'. No, it's PNC, January 15 months....  Come on................. be? You over people... small, and not.. computer........, all over the....... school because I or dation as... I have understand...  How the fuck are you putting it there?.. not..... four, I, are you know, it's, are.... I.. Hi, how you going?  Good, man, how are you? what the information. and switching nice other video is just catch people up. Lucky for you that you got to do that the rest of the day.  What did you gonna do? I've been just talking to just actually just say a I bin and Serey andock, so yeah, yeah, I did the morning thing and it's been nothing but meeting since that that's how it is.. I just like see myself to product and making sure that I know exactly the operates and the different features. but it's good.  But to know what to do there's definitely way more of a circus area in the product than I thought so. huge. Yeah, that's yeah, cool. Very nice.  Cool. Yeah. You in smart?  I hear every day. I. I, so lot. Yeah, you here you.  One. I think that right? T Domini. family, I'm sorry. check it.  Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.. Got a quick question for you.  Um, I'm looking at the high level plan. I think that's name inira, for the PNC release. Uh, not familiar with the plans product very much in, um, Europe, it looks to me like the answer is you guys can just manually put things in there, so those things that are in there aren't because they are all associated with the label.  They are in there because somebody's did something and says, this thing in there. Any problem with everything that's in there giving it a label. like putting a label on every item? Well, there's only 15 items in there.  I keep so, I keep wanting to know the exact this the answer to this question. Do we know everything that has to be done for PNC and do we understand the cost? Right.  So if I look at the the high level plan and look at all those things in there, that's all the things that at least right now. labels that have 15 must have just the stuff that we finalized that we must need to like the blocker. If we don't have these items by the 15th, it doesn't need to be there by the 15th. Uh, there's must have and then like four of them there is a there's. after he gave me the three pages I took that to John, Jay and Bren and they're like, we don't need all that.  What do you think the Jira plan is that? the high level plan? Correct.  I right now I'm looking at the must haveves. So you're not even looking at high level plan? No, we put the filter and we have an edited version called PNC John 15 must have like maybe 10 items.  That's what we're using, and we need all those 15 items planned estimated, whatever, whatever. something real quickly. So, when I look at that plan, so this is so okay, cool? More than ten things.  Yeah, but a lot like under this most of this done. Yeah, they' both those okay, cool. But the only way things are in here is because somebody did something that they don't all hear anymore, for instance. houses must have probably here.  They all have must haveves in this. there's like a billion labels, but like the common one is mustads. So when I just say show me everything in g that has must haves. yeah, I'm only getting I' only to eat things here, but that could be me, labels this. I'm not doing it from any like, are there statuses that are probably like, and do you do like you probably wanna put all of them in there?  Um. It's that previous new showed me that's the list? Yeah.  It's thease item.. Which is again, why I was it okay, cool. I actually I need some way to refer to this outside of.  And so I'm like, cool, if that's the list and you think this is the list? Any problem with me just going in adding a label on all those? Cool.  Thank you. Yeah. what I was trying to get to and I could do that, so thank you.... I', that are... more... more we were there.... more..  No, um, you have a by the very end. Do you haveins where you leave? That was your first time in?  Do you know abouterey used to having my job and was demoted years ago because he did something wrong? could be it's it's for your time, so you may not know every time. Well, listen, he described it as your job.  That was his words to be, your job. I used to have your job.. It was years ago, years and years ago people at one point they go home?  So he lost this right. he said it in a very similar way. was like, where he did. I was like, okay, I gotta go ask. okay, cool. Yeah. um. it was an interesting day.  I found out but I talked. I think he he has strong opinions not held loosely. I think he thinks everybody else is idiots, but engineering, butgrudgingly, he can say maybe engineering isn't pro is has a little bit of mod, but not nearly compared to everybody else. he wanted to talk about this another crazy thing today and he can he Sean and uh Ivan. and I went, okay, wait, wait, why are we talking about this?  Like, what's the like, tell me the bullet point that is the customer? needs this, and I can go put it on the website and I go put that and they buy me and they spend more money. Okay, it's not that cool.  Is this 4PNC? No. all this. Like, I literally went to the bathroom, with John, said, I don't think you need to be here.C I still have to Socratic method things right now.  I have to like, listen and I can't just be like, but dude, like, we're not doing what you're saying, what he wants us to go do. It could be right engineering wise, but it's like nothing to do with what we need to do right now. not a goddamn thing. like you know, these things are supposed to know, we' hanging out over here Correct. correct. I was like, I was making sense.  That was here today. that's what you needed. That's John's like, he's telling me everything he needs to fucking tell me, man. like, listen, he's the only one that I have a stronger pity enough for him. sorry, I have an pity from Serey also. He's the only one that I have a strong opinion of.  And yeah, he needs that. Nope. Sean and I said no.  It's because he it's because he already knows. and he already knows. he's he's in here. collecting a paycheck. there we have more than a few of those, so through the time off, we have people in Serbia in Eastern Europe who' taken like 60 days off. must be nice. must be nice. Yeah, um, he's also so like there's things he says that I think I agree with, like from last week, like, Shawn doesn't want to spend any money on people. Yeah, okay, first of all, hes, he doesn't spend any on people here, but yes, yes. um and yes, I think his opinion of what we should go to pay for something is wrong.  Cool. He just needs to be he't he's not wrong because he's maliciously wrong. He's wrong because he's no.  And he see somebody to tell him now. That's fine. and somebody to tell him with that with a 40 and convinced, like, he's not gonna believe anything from any of us, and he's not gonna live in me right now. He may be a little bit of said it. but I mean, cool.  So how to what he says. But like, yeah, no, I'm pretty sure that's his thing. But what I told them is, hey guys, I'm not underpaid.  I'm not overpaid and I'm towards the lower end of market, but I'm not at the low end. so maybe he's turning over another leaf, maybe it's the beginning. But like, I'm not underpaid and I told him last week, I think you're not crack, dude. like, I can't goagger a team for that. But that's just all that means is how many people I can hire, doesn't like, if the answer is because I just walk the teams through the cost like I was like, cool, help me understand the business.  And we work through and the answer is, I believe we're bringing in about six million dollars a year. Figured out how. I believe we're costing about six.  I'm spent mine's three to 3.5. Sorry, we where're spending six just on head count that not facilities, that's not hosting, that's not fucking a I' not fucking I have two $800 fucking m I'm barely happy. There's tons of them.  There's tons of them. I was first day I was like no. But there' all the the only people that would have these um the only they have to replace this when I'm told.  And I was like, what? But but like you bought me a fucking another fucking iPhone and I was like, okay, like you have to buy me a computer, but an iPhone, I was like, so like the only people that would have these monitors in my organization developers. Developers could use this real estate, but rest of us motherfuckers.  Yeah. okay, yeah, yeah. I will get this into a situation that will be useful to me when I bring in all the rest of my shit, but yeah, no, like the spending is weird right now. I I'm there's things that I'm like, why do I have $60 for the monitors here, and I see lots of them. but I'm gonna spend 90 on a senior edge I'll figure this out.  Okay. helpful at all talk to them? Oh, it was definitely helpful. talk about jellyfish stuff? Uh, I asked it on and I was like, hey, um, did you spend some time with that?  Oh, not much? I was like, okay, I figured so. And then he and then he was like, you didn't send it to me.  I'm like, no, I didn't send it two people to do nothing with. So I sent it to one person. He did nothing. okay.  I'm really curious when that comes back, I was. So, well, that's my data is actually correct. I'm not wor I'm not worried about the asics I'm like I guess I have to fight with Serey about it.  I even told him. So far Seri, the answer is I asked him, so what they they have two things they have to do for you at tomorrow. Sorry, and I didn't. like, this is part of this is me trying to figure out, cool, I gave them tasks.  I was not clear on when I wanted it done by. They did not get clarity. So I was like, okay, cool. let's see how this goes.  Tomorrow at 4 o'clock. If I don't get my lists from them, then they will get another email from me. He has another thing for me, which is that he hasn't started thread between me and um I forgot the person.  Uh, no. Ar Arc Arc, Arc. Yes. um, because he was supposed to do shit for um the the clovever something I was going on.  There's a short term in a long term, there's uh things he'd asked for, because all he does is scream about everybody else isn't doing anything. At one point I looked at both of them and said, you're the CTO and you're the chief architect. When I say leadership vacuum, it's the people in this room I'm talking about.  Everybody else we have to tell them what to do. try out what my babysit people. That's your job, our job is babysitting and it sucks. engineering has no people management. Yeah.  It's between the two and them and they just. And then he's like, well, you have product project managers and you have scrrum masters and you have jobs offer development managers and I'm like, I have a lot of people. and that so I walked and dress like, yeah, and I was like cool. In a perfectly functioning product engineering organization.  What percentage of your people would be developers and what percentage of people be everything else? Don't get complicated now cause I can get really complicated and what percent should be QA and what to what's doesn't the answer was 80 20. Like that's great.  80 20. I've never it's been a long time since I've had a bigger team. That's 80 20, but I'll take it 8020.  We're 50, 50. did you say that? Oh, no, we're not. I'm like, I guarantee I'm a little bit off.  We're 50, 50. So now that we're 5050 and there's 80, 20 is your perfection, clearly there's some slump in the system, right? Okay.  Um, yeah, it the lack he's blaming everybody for ownership. The utter does each other for not taking ownership, noning ownership. they don't understand that. The ownerships are with those two, and the answer is I'm more than willing to give you a different job here.  First of all, he's not a chief architect. I'd know how muchody he's going to checking in. That doesn't make any sense to me.  And the thing he's passionate over, he says his process. Now he scares me to fucking death with that right now because I'm like? I've seen a lot, yes.  E. He'singruiting with this processes. He's all about the processes. Except for like he's all about telling people what to do, is that what I can tell.  It's not about process, it's about I wanna tell you what to do. and my answer is cool. um, nobody here has a job of telling you what to do. Everybody has a job of do it. So let's go figure out how to get that in.  And I'm gonna have to figure out with him, cause like, he's bitching about like the thing he wanted to talk about today. I was like, I don't know if you know what we're talking about this. But in it he was very clear that like, we can't we've proven here that we just can't go tell people what to go do and then they go do what we told them to go do.  I'm, but that's what you're do you're gonna go buy this software for a team that's not you what? when it's it's not it's four. He it's for that, but he'll also tell you it's that that quinte tech is not a good use of the technology it what's used for.  And I'm like, so you want to bring me something that doesn't solve one of our problems right now? I don't think that's the right thing. the demo tomorrow. Okay, wellm not to buy it, but, okay, I don't I don't have enough data right now to tell people what they can and can't do.  But at some point, I'm gonna be involved in a decision, my answer is I I don't have enough information that says, Well, it's just our priorities are just all of the place. So I'm like, the biggest thing that I've told even like the answer is the problem here is a lack of leadership. That is the problem.  We need to understand. Here's how we do our job. Here's the job we need to go do, hold you accountable.  We need to figure that out right now. So, okay. leadership and ownership is things here. Yeah, I don't I gotta get to the bottom of him right now, He's he's fascinating.  He I he I'm weird out by him right now. His he seems to be completely burnt on the dumbness of this company. Yeah.  Everything is but I'd also like it. I ran enough Ukrainians and I'm putting them all in the same cat. I ran enough eastern Europeans to know they're just negative by default.  And that's different than they're negative. They're just negative by defaults, right now I don't know. But like, watching him and Ivan go at it was interesting.  Um, and I'm sitting there going, I'm agreeing with Ivan, how he's thinking about things right now, and you are not agreeing. He's So but he gets talked over until he starts, like, yeah, yells and you know, and he does a lot of that. So I gotta figure out what to make circey good at, cause I'm not sure what he's good at.  But I'm sure what he wants to talk about is all process, which is not a. that is so if you like that's bullshit for me and for people that look like, why do you want to talk with you with that? You don't want to be with not you different story. Let's go figure out what you want to go there and for.  Okay, we're gonna be in a second. Thank you for everything.. Sorry., hey, everyone, good.  What are you talking your valirm breaks with me? I'm an old man. I've always go to the bathroom, so I drink a ton of water, with the bathroom. lightning, I don't have to learn, but um people are not in their records.  I don't know what their records are, but um seems to be very passionate about things that have nothing with other.. That should have good? I ask him to come back and okay. what do you do what?  Um Hey, I'll be in a sec, okay, what? guys. I got it.  Wanna go for a walk? I think they having a conversation with that comedy tomorrow. one that we were having a meeting about.. I don't know what seems like bad night.m, I mean, it's gonna speed up our development that we're working on now.  Somebody go through that.. And then I'm find spending the money on it. I' and I get the he's trying to say, that that is only work answer is all that stuff, we're gonna convert over this thing.  And at the answer is, it's just another project that gets 10% of the w on and we move out of something else, then something.. I'? He has a very 95% about that are not with the prob right to the problem.  What your motic that there's no you or no confidence here. is a completely material, um, and actually? I know one of my. I'm B. I'm very glad for what, and something that happened to work on, you can justrupt, you know. especially as an executive, you can't let exactly.ep, you, you.  So cool. um so that yeah, we don't that that's so to the bottom and stick exactly and forward to quickly, that, um, they have two things actually, we have they each up the advance to give me which is you the people on the one that we put for the, and whether the reason why and what that way to sounds like we figuring out what stop the bing, I gotta stop the bleeding. I tell we can't afford to, you? We'll go then I'll, you?  And then has another thing because one of the things he's complaining about with the over thing is, um, I'm gonna get names wrong. I think it's hard, though. Yes, yeah.  Even like, I am for a shortirm and a long termm triper, for all of this. and no one's gotten back to me. I was like, you? I's like, another one's I'm like you fucking leadership isn't that you me. like, that's what you have to do here.  Now, we have to give the team here how we do work, here's our expectations and here's your job. you know? That's clear that not being done right now well. But until exactly. until we do that, that's what we have to go through, hold up.  I need you to send a team to me and part explaining you're as what, like you're what you. and ask him for us, you know? Then we'll go from the. And so right now, my test is on on person. ready to do what you need to read for that to do within a reasonable time.  You know, and that that. I can't let them decide I'm coming. I wouldn' right now that's my test together, this stuff just and then we can figure out from there and then we getey we can figure out okay. if this guy is really that bad, you guys are already keep that bad.  I keep this is a lot of reasons things are bad is a lack of. Some of these people will come around because they are and they understand the.. I don't understand I still game put in that one fucking time that they said. let's think about the.?  I don't know. but tomorrow that's what I've been looking for is I told. So, do you interview with everybody go the goal is you to get straight for normally mind you? This is the last one and everything could be like you don't.  Is it before often still or is it afterwards before we get offward? Yeah, so that needs to get uh, you know, I know, our store small enough stuff that we're not gonna be like I think I also like three is our are meaningful and important, and the worsting the size of my old, you, that completely lied about everything right to the board and fuck everything up. It was ign no difference in organization when it was the.  That person's giving him a priority and also the cliff, the customer of that? You can a lot of that slash great executive to bring for the, you, but there's something special about a yo. and so it's like, no, I want you to special special. I want you.  I just in your folks and I with your culture, but I want to have you otherwise it's it's and you need it especially and you're all fucking fucking what our cult is from. I want small employees now all these contractors and it's not worth. And they see to they don't see how to get out of it, and I answer they answer right now either I don't.  But it clearly but I'm looking at things going listen, one of the things seems like, John't wanna pay for the pizza one. I'm like, guys, listen. Tell me very clear.  I'm not at the top of the CTO pay scale, and I'm not at the bottom, so he's clearly paying me in a valid way. Maybe I a unique first. My answer is real, I think he's already there.  Now, he's understand what that means.., there's a budget, right? And if we're gonna hire someone at 150,000, that replaces 280,000. so I'm looking at things right now like, they' put your budget constant clos mine of the. B, what you about that, though, that'll look like more people here, but those more people here are gonna be more excessive, so even look like a little and the third, the reason I'm not the best one?  is there is what I I believe I could do I doing today. with a four four people. Like I expect your if you're gonna do that growth, your product engineering team whole people is calling in 20 people.. I I the same thing.  And when I look at this, one of the things I walk through is in your perfect world first. what did a team of 100 people how many people how maybe wouldn't about? versus everything else. Don't worry about me about all the different things, you know everything else.  And his answer was 80 20. and I'm like, great, you and I agree. That is a level of perfection, though, that we can't ever get to, but that is the propotic solid. Where are we at?  I don't know, but I believe we're right around 50/50. around 33 56. for people that are accessing by the code? and? Oh, you, so people acting right from here, you talking this talking about SM furnit Everybody, every because it's all the towns. like the answer is you and the customers more like.  Right. All you all the customer cares about is somebody that bails out a feature. so that bang on a feature, I need to all the rest of that is what I need to like, make a develop a hole, because they're not gonna tell customers and're not gonna design. And it's not one to one, and again, in perfection immedi it's never 820, but we are more like 5050 and my answer is that is a whole other level of expense p..  And I was like, okay, so he's like, we have what he talking about? Like before we had the donor here, right? that was like me and and all of us actually doing all of the productors stuff.up, but you know the thing is, we got an hour walk when we're done..  So, we do have product owners now. and and uh principal product managers, right? But we get a hell of a lot less requirements stuff. It's because they took what and I don't know exactly what you and data were doing.  But here's my it was right on the mechanic of potistan, isn't it? But the piv on the vision and the pyation., I would say it was much heavier on the mechanics of it now. Oh, I didn't compared now.  I mean the two of you were probably very heavy into what is the custom need, what's the vision? what's the priization? But when it came down to I mean 30 stories for all this tomorrow, like the answer is, okay, I'm gonna give you five, you guys are gonna figure out.  I would say we were accomping I forgot about that, because I can't sleep that there there' stories. getting away. That's my problem if we were doing user story napping we developed a understood. We were doing a lot more us for but that was a part time job for us.  And what I go on understand is we have so many polon people and they can't accomplish what we're doing part time. Surey'sonse to that, and I don't know whether this is true. It feels true. is you hire people at titles that believe they do those things that are you hire big company people that believe that big companies principles do these work. what they don't do is these world, and my answer is, hey, cool, great.  Uh, you back guys, because that's sort of crazy. We' 40 people, and the answer is, you're gonna be in one of these jobs and you're gonna do it all, and you're gonna do what whatever we go. get it... is you're a principal person for today. you? I don't think to the I don't even have any people strategy.  I don't even that at all. I don't what Jader would be able with the customers a lot more, I're gonna have a lot more inside of the product. nothing is that done, and so again, maybe I have to reach the next expectation. Maybe they' sign up for that whole thing that have done before?  Cool, whatever. But the answer is what get to what they jobs these.. Let's figure out who can use that job?  Let's offer them the ability you use that job and let's hold them a comfortable that job. and if they' interesting to get a jobs, that's fine. and it is negotiation. I get that you signed up for and France. We will figure that out, we will try to do a very possible.  I get 10 extra value for my developers, we are in the wrong business. So that's how you know maybe be thinking about things, how are we gonna get 10 XL for every single person in here. That's our goal.  But they don't understand that either money you do understand, right? Most companies, right? R&D costs, max are like 20%, right?  Ely on it' different. It's 10 plus years. and a company our size and probably. And at that point in time, the developers are expecting to produce 10X because if they're not, it doesn't cover the cost of them.. and the answer is, okay, we have. the price for software 100ucks like, so cool.  Then they have to be a change. Exactly as you can go do this, enough.. that is what we have to that you ready? Yeah.  You ready? get my back. Okay, are you ready?  Weather. What could the Kirk to you, because he was co coach, also, I believe.. Oh, that was.  He's years ago. Yeah, because I think Charles my Lat Charles, where I first met K Kirk. who was Charles is that he. Yeah, so, uh Kirk knows set up at well that' own each other, but like 15 years.  I think Edward number up to like five or so, yeah. Yeah, I just stopped be catching up with them this weekend, and I was talking to him mobile about Eesmer like, no, that's true.. Brett's Brett's been a rat where knows where the bodies are.. um and he has been having off. top couple years so.  What? So, I mean, I'm really close to a lot of the people there a lot of people to be there. yeah, no, it's been you know, so I'm sorry right.ough business. It's a very tough business and generative AI changed everything on them. so dramatically. that it's like, I I think they're a name.  I think they're in a really bad position at this point, because they don't have to the size of a team. with Unfortunately, too much money got put in this place and now everybody wants on an 80% solution of what they do, and it's good enough, because the answer is, I'm gonna have a robot that I'm gonna be doing like this is better than you guys are doing enough, so that's the problem there is because it really is. In general AI is coming. So the AI just caught out, what a 96 IQ score?  Yeah it's it's listen, dip that. I don't want to be a developer. No, don't want to be a developer.  It the first use case. Yeah. All of you all the kids don't need you kids.  Yeah. I still need the old ones, and then kids. and and my middle trial is a developer, and I was like, no, don't do this. Don't do this.  And then he went to work withannie Mae and I was like, dude, like you're not going any of the skills that you need to be able to live with this that. Yup.... No, I are you going to the Mexican place again?  It that oy price where exactly oyster place. You brought me.. everyone knows Oh, my place huh. I heard you were already did.  Hello, you like, that here, that place.. You are not surprised at all. And I was like, for hooters like 3 times left.  Like the Mexico are there? Okay. Thank you for telling me that, so I don't make that.  They mistake. I'm going there right every day. for not going to bring my team there. That I could go there whenever I want.  I'm not gonna have a fucking happy hour with the team that. that I don't either. so imagine the waitresses very little clothes. and very openight. Oh, this, uh that's the next found. I would uh..  Sorry. Uh, it's your play. Don Don't die.  Don't say that I I uh for you to me.. Don't. I first out.  You wanna get? I wanted to show you that. I't want.  You. I've been twice. time whose is it? Well get to know where you leave, right and work. who told me about the number?  for your neighborhood. I Yeah, I started on a walking to find a place around here. I thought. you one in the air and I'm like, okay, and it looks like. worth for you. normal.  I wouldn't say normal. I think they're trying to copy like a Hoo site byara. not sure if they're doing the problem with it, but. I mean the.  It's not like they domain, but downtown I've worked up bridge, I picked up in the area. Yeah, they're all they're all the same. like, yeah, you can walk from like this food. I like our office space up there a lot now.  I mean, you have to worry about traffic, so's good. It's not a place exactly. I how long does it big you there?  I went from my dark I opened up a house my company in my team that was uh far west in my3. far about the now I just basically I went to the other way now and it's a little bit longer so I did. and not too long. Now I'll be a bit. especially when a month that we land like 12 are., you won't have the American Hollywood. I get.  So, I mean, I just got diamonds again. so that's how much I was traveling, you probably gonna lose up. I did it for a year, so I'm gonna lose it, but like I'm going to uh Tokyo and Saigon next year, so a little hope it'll be it'll be it better then, so. I won't move on.  I'fortunately. Yeah, too much travel. I'll be happy though what I do finally lose them?  Yeah. Well, I I never went to traveler before. This is the first I've ever had a job that would be traveling. and uh yeah it it's a lot.  Yeah, Yeah. I'm up. I'm fine if you could a different column, but I haven't don't believe it with that like, you weird that.  It just my first day. You know, so maybe we tell me a strike, I don't know you're a liar so answered you sick, but my real answer is, hm, mean that but response times I'm getting new. I'll ask you.  I think you can go. That's what I think. I think you know.  Well, we all have to figure out lots of structureapron is for what life. But we also can't have, like, Daniel andory and although supporting it you to in my mind. just have to be something else, but in the short term it's gonna be like gotta have everything to me and then figure out and so, unless you were saying that you wanna hire somebody else or an executive over there that I don't take the executives over there here.. So, like, yeah, I perfection for the pen, like, really it depends how you developers we have.  That'll tell us how many body people we have, and that'll tell us if I have management and product problems, or just I need one or these product. That's, you know? This is the one.  It's never looked that bad. That's the one. Oh, I was great. sports work, so that they have a bunch of screens there.  Yeah, it's definitely a sports bar, and I wouldn't say they were any less close of who it was like a hoo, but not is uh, the easy church from there that. I would disagree with it all over our opinions. Ion, what do you think?  I don't know. I kind of like a hair. I guess the time. a very lucky.  That was really like hot bar for or like a minute and then. I think the last time it was probably like two decades ago. I would have to go.  It's been I don't think my youngest is born, though at least take years, so young. I mean, my oldest gone. So that's at least a hell 11 years. but on circuit, you guys married, have kids?  Yeah. I'm not. Not you.  Jerry, I already got either. Yeah, not not married, no kids. funny. I got four, so.  I got three, so, but. I'm done. I't done, done, done.  I'm done minor one younger. You know, sorry. I'm done all through the par. now is like, you're an 18 year old.  You're in the dog. It's a different form of parenting is a point... This is.  Coaching in a funding college. So five pig here. That's been the agreement from the beginning with all of our kids. because me and my wife both my my parents and pay me.  My parents pay for me, and that's where my wife and I my wife, her parents didn't say her. Our kids are not being paid for. We'll help on with other stuff, but college, I didn't even know how much of an hour either of college and I tried to didn't college that.  I dropped out and down his attack. He dropped out. I dropped out I mean all the reason I went back.  I underad and master was so I could teach, right? business. 10 years ago, getting. I believe we still believe you need us degree to get a job.  I don't believe that anymore. Why dropped out the end of my I, but the nice thing about I don't even want to the university. you know, I a friend social expired. didn't require.... I think there at the bar in what's the call a strip bar right here.?  I think they're calling this one.. We just cut off maybe hours I drop for the go back and go to your house right now, right? I' drive.. push... you.  I.... No... What about the right across the?  No, uh, what the 20 you talking about? No, what if problem?. open? Okay, let's go. did you think?  I don't drink it much anymore. I'm usually a burden guy. I. yeah, old passes are good.  I, uh, two years ago, we were like, I used to be a pretty big drinker, but and it was the only time like, and I live so for me to work for him. I don't not great, but I'm not a hard. The hanger was just. the hanger was the first three mark.  They did not use the hurt. Now they make.. last week, I drink a lot more water again. over and And I didn't it all in Vegas.... I like, right?  I thought I was I'm not tired. I. I won, right?.. I wouldn't recommend. so that that with my friend. one of my friends lost his leg, 25 years ago, car accident.  And um he was there. I talked about his leg. I and then the part is over, he had he and him, uh huh.  And he was really drunk side, but then he was also doing anything, you know. and I get real high. I would be curious. and then, yeah, I had to take care of him until 10 o'clock the next morning because uh. Yeah, no.  I was not happy. I was not happy. He was not happy about it., I said, what's the problem?  I'm like drunk guy doesn't have a leg. upset. I can understand. for you, like that I just reinvent like four times of the I think I could think today. no. I got.  That.? Yeah, but I got it. Vegas...  Everyone down in the music. You'll have to come for that.. What's you again?  I haven't heard that. normally.. a lot of what's. It's be whatever else to do being in. Yeah, actually, you have like, now, all of the all their lot techn though, openars. car rent off open bar. a little.  Yeah, yeah.. Yup, a reinvented the same way. I don't even know how much, like.  I't a clean would be. I don't what. I like to.  I don't know how it big it is to, reinmit isain warm and just the other company is not not Amazon. going to the. Yeah, since we got four,000 people that they're. that was a not. when they open and yep.. I have to figure that all. renting up the fear doesn't seem like a under a couple million that high.  We all justing off the spear like score. the liquor probably on top of that for another double map. Okay. I'llab I'll get strapped.  Okay. three in.. We's been a couple of years. been before COVI since I've been back back.. plus my team have always been too big at that point where I get my team bel along. year or two that I've been like you gotta go. I don't anymore. thing about money20 it really almost almost.  That is both. and it's a great engineer. It is and you know, that quickly usually has a kind of talk always capital one, people that say them rush a lot, you know, therefore you can, you learn a lot about, like hear how they do it. and especially like death with Nets uh open source of tons of this stuff do Yeah, my own board number. The company he started in a lot there.  They were managing, you know, cloud health, they were managing all there. Cloud spanned, so they played the fortune on that, too. budget they kept trying to get me. I used them a little bit. um but that was a quickly commoditized business. itself.  He still got out for a good amount, good for him. He got out for half a billion. That's more than a good amount then, so good for him.  I was a smallest exit, so and really good for him.. So he was with money at that point. And he still counted what he sold, he sell 20% actually, wasn't uh he's not a bad exit 100 million, so Nope, not at all.  Not at all. But yeah, he tried to probably sell it out. It's probably worth less than that at this point., there is it's completely I haven't used a third party platform in three jobs because the what Amazon gives you isn't great. and what, jee, Google gives you isn't great?  It's enough for anything but the most you have to be a really complicated case to need something that's a third party, not from like that. I mean, doesn't it helps, but it's like it's up but the money. Plus all the work you have to put in configuring it and making your teams be able to use it correctly, so out here.  So seems to care about process. Yes. he doesn't implement the processes. It's more consulting on that end.  It is is it good at it? No, I would say no, it's not a strange. Why?  Because again, just trying to put people in the right roles, because I'm looking at his code contributions going, okay, well, at least lately there's not there. all he wants to do is talk about process with the exception of he's talking about this platform thing. So he's talking to me, like architecture in theory, like, okay, so far, you wanna draw pretty pictures. I don't care about pretty pictures. like those are those are necessary, but not important, and I think we're way too small to have someone's job to be make pretty pictures, so you have to have other jobs.  So, um and then I'm looking at eat I've been going actually, you want to make pretty pictures also, but you actually want to cold them also, so don't think we need two people drawing pretty pictures. So I was like, okay, well, maybe you're a process guy because that's what you wanna talk about. Not sure you have any skills there, but if you have passion there, that's a different story.  Uh, even if you have passion, I think the problem with the process part is you have to get by in, um, and that's not what he's strong at. so, it is, like soft power, I'm pretty sure he's horrible at... So, and and not only that, he is so impotent at it that it impuriates him. It makes him angry.  So because even if he's right, he can't get by and just how he presents it. Yes. And won't take coaching, like again, I just kept going, Kate, let's talk about talk about it this way.  No, no, no, no. listen in my way, okay. I'll listen to your way, man, you know better than me for sure right now. So, yes, but start with why are we building this?  Why do you wanna build this thing? I don't understand. So.  And I'm not against doing things that are gonna improve what we're doing but there has to be a reason for it. And if we had that's what I was trying to get him and to agree on, well, doing. In the infinititude, yes However, how long does it take to get us?  I'm looking for it to the next, you know what I mean? And if it can't it doesn't make sense right now. I I so I don't know enough about it right now.  I'll bet you, uh, $1 thousand dollars it cannot give us value in the next two quarters. I would not take you on that unfortunately. No.  I still haven't been sold myself cell on it. That's why I've been like, okay, let's let see. and like, even with the poweragon, I'm like, no, not until you've actually done research am I gonna actually even get on the phone with her. I finally got on the phone with her last, uh, week. but I'm like, okay, let's figure this out.  Yeah. I I I'm only reading tea leaves, but the biggest give to me there was what's the first thing you did put with this? Oh, you'd reimment quickBooks cool. engineering, driven.  I'm gonna give you the same thing only better. Okay, but by better. What do you mean by better?  Oh, no, no, it's just better. No, no, no, like, how do you quantify that? No, no, it's the same thing.  Oh, okay. Well, most of our customers usuallyBooks integration, right? and they're not having problems with we shouldn't if they're having problems with it, tell me if you're our salon and you're integration is not working and it's not going to your accounting, you know, oh, well, we have to look at the, you know, I do understand you have to actually look at the what's going on with the data, right?  But we don't have the monitoring in place, maybe there. But I can tell you, the second there is a problem there. Our customers would be calling us like crazy. we haven't got an issue from a customer and over a year.  So on the other hand, book by we're having all of these issues with right now. so in my mind these things that are happening with the clover devices. are a hell of a lot more important than a QuickBooks thing that we haven't had an issue within a year. It's maybe it's not perfect, right? But do you care about something that we haven't had a problem with in a year?  He like working code is always better than refored I know it works, leave it alone. So, no, there this does none of it makes any sense. Um, if we have a there observative ability problem and by watching teams, we do, um that's the problem to go solve.  Building this this other thing that has other thing. I'm like, stop, like, we can build observability into the platform this second. let's go understand what that is, and we if we're gonna build observability, right?. I would build it in the places where I have problems right now and things we not. or new stuff.  Yeah, and then and then you back it in that's exactly what you do. Like you're not if you haven't had a problem, I'd have to go back and quick folks, but say we haven't had a problem in three years then, right? I Why do you build monitoring to that right now?  It's like, okay, maybe it's gonna have a problem at some point in time, but we have right now, we have clover that's failing on us in a bunch of different situation. The only way we were it is if we built observability, put it every place else, and the only place that we're still missing it was there, then the answer is this prioritized making sure that we can fix that when there's a problem. But if the answer is, you're telling me that most of these services are not at all the same, they have just developers doing them their own way.  They're not observable. Cool, let's go fix that and go fix it for the ones that are either problematic or new, and then keep forwarding them along the way. So that's what I got from Serey, what he was telling me, and that mule softer paragon would be the way to get it done much, much faster.  And at that's the case, that's a different story than what I was hearing with you guys in there. Yeah, I'm not seeing that, but I'm not saying I know just a little of but I I' use me soft. I've never used paragon.  But um for 50 grand, if it's gonna save us 60% on an integration like Winx and then we can have it continue to help us, it's well worth the money, right? But it has to be able to do that. and they're gonna have to show me a lot of data that tells me cause you're just changing one shitty solution for a different slightly less shitty solution. So it's like, okay, show me the data behind it.  Don't tell me it's better because it's the thing. like, stop. show me. show me. and you may not be able to show me without actually doing the POC. You might not be able to. And I don't know why we would just like take a risk on it.  Like, this is a very known the other thing is that 50,000 is one cost, right? But then what's the other cost for additional development that we're spending there if we throw it out? I mean because it's not $50,000 and now that it's50,000, and then all the ones we create, and then I don't know what an upper bound of this thing is.  It's not just that sounds like a platform fee that they're gonna be adding out something like okay, I The upper bound is not that bad on it. the upperbond originally was very bad on it. I actually was able to negotiate them to a pretty reasonable upper bound. It's not bad on there.  Cool. if it delivers value. Yep. if it doesn't deliver value, there's just no point.. So again, we're gonna have to spend money to fix some things and make the money we want on these partnerships, but we can't.  We're a small company. We can't afford to spend money on stuff that are head projects. Oh, agreed.  But what I need you determining is what are the pet projects and what are the real projects? Yup. Agreed.  But all the stuff we're doing for enterprise, we're not having the same level of problems as the stuff that we're doing for the clover stuff. was the first customer that went? A year ago.. is it just a bunch of new features that we've added lately, and that's why it's brittle now or is it cause it hasn't always been brittle. Was it because there was no users on it, and now there's users on it?  There't many users on it, but the users weren't having problems, so I'd that's not the problem. in the main problem is just started, like, to get this bad was just over the past, like, month and a half. um I don't think the team knows what happens, and I still don't know what caused it, right? I mean, Serate doesn't know, and he says he doesn't know because Arc didn't tell him what he need to tell him, and so that's why I'm like, okay, do this today. We'll figure out if I can drive Arc/other people to get us that information, but let's make sure we are clear with what we are asking for and what we need and let's make sure we are clear with what we're gonna get it from. has any idea.  I've tried to get it out of he has no idea what's going on there. We will I don't have much of a doubt. If you guys are already saying that, and I'm looking at John going, I'm not sure then the guy that I don't even know anything about is probably a problem.  I think it was just a bad hiring and we had him relocate to our Halifax office and I think what were we doing? I don't know. So I was actually um traveling during that time at our uh I had some meetings and then I had our uh was over in Serbia and somehow I dropped the ball because I got skipped on that whole process of hiring him and interviewing him. and I think we screwed up really badly there.  What are you going to feel comfortable to do to unwind that with him? mind if you have that decision, I think we're gonna have to give like three months severance uh fix it in my mind. Even though he's only been with us a couple of months, I think we fucked up we have to own it, you know.  I just was trying to figure out where your head was at, cause if your head was he hasn't been here, fuck him. It's like, man, like I won't lose sleep today now 12 months when it's like but my answer is okay, but no you're you're like, cool, you're gonna have to do something to unwind it all right. I think we do.  We've had those discussions already, but I haven't wanted to unwind it until you came in. and made sure, cause obviously if he can be saved and he can do the job that's a lot better than having done wine. this situation. But if we have donewind yet, I'd say based on the situation we did, we probably get a give three month salary and just say, okay, sorry, it's not working. And you know, we wish you the best.  Hopefully you can find something, but and what so Palifax office, who what all parts of the company are up there? That's. part of the reason we opened that was mainly to try to relocate people uh that we have in eastern Europe over there because it's easier..c I wanted more people on the same time zone. um why didn't that happen? Because no one ended up wanting to move that far from Russia.C then I could have had him as employees, you know, working up there, it would have made things like we got a couple visas and then they didn't wanna move, you know, I understand it's far, you know what I mean but for us right now, having contractors like we have all these people that were employees now they're contractors, and now they take time off whenever they don't wanna come into the office, they wanna work from Fiji or mostly Bali and you know, it just doesn't work for us well anymore..  Hey, so I gotta get to know the the people, like, and right now, I'm, you know, trying to get the people from those two, and then who do I care about? Um cause they don't say, you know, there's they're like there's people that should keep and they we've already lost some of the people that we should have kept. But they say the same things about people and time and they don't want to work and and I'm like, okay, I don't understand.  Like, they don't wanna work, this is easy. Like, they're not working and they don't want to work, let's all agree not to spend any more money then, because we're not losing anything. So, I don't understand.  So I was like, I just need you to tell me guys, who are the people we can't afford this? And then I will figure out whether I agree with you, but, like, just give me that list first, you know? And then we'll figure out, cause like, man.  I just we can't we can't operate like this, and part of the problem, I think, uh, for them, too, is we had some people that were working well as employees in an office, right? And now that they're contractors and can work from wherever the hell they want, not doing a good job anymore. Yep.  And that's But of course, there's also part of the problem that our product requirements were not involving developers anymore in the process. I like fighting like crazy with product demon like, you gotta get the developers involved or they're not gonna they're gonna create crap stop, which is what they're doing.. Because if they don't know what they're doing, why are they doing it?  So, I don't know why we can't get that it just seems like a simple concept. Because if you have developers believing in what you want to develop and you explain why you want to develop it, they can do a pretty good job and a lot of the ones we had we're already doing a pretty good job of that and we've lost some good ones because we're not doing that anymore that's like I'd love to talk to a couple of them that left to say like, tell me why. because I I can articulate a lot of reasons of why it is, but what specifically was the things that were that that that made you guys leave so uh they've been pretty open about it. I think uh I could set you up with some of them information, too, but easily.  Perfect. No, I have learned a long time ago. Even though it's Austin, I't heard about of the head of it leaving.  I was in Atlanta for too long and oh, yeah, no, I just watching so many of my teams get their uh back goinging out of car and I was like, nope. I will get the call us back I can.'s what I call my wife....... So, after your first day, do you think hiring is a priority then?  I' still not.. the answer is, what am I hiring?. I don't know who who I'm hiring. I don't know for what job. and I definitely don't know what outside of engineering, but even with engineering, my answer is, huh, which what type of developer do I need?  Not sure, except for here. but still doing the same thing Amara. There is not changing changing what' going on tomorrow, but but as far as that type of developer, what do you mean by a typether it's our full stack or whether it is like, what what's the specific thing we need? Because ooh, what skills do we need replaced?  or augmented? And so my answer right now is I don't know, like one of the problems with having developers of them running back end, it's tricky because there are if one person running it right in front end, one person running the back end, more complicated in that way. Agreed.  Here's my 25 year opinion. F stackers are bullshit. The answer is they're either a front end or a back end. and when the ones that call themselves front end are either front end and they're not scared of back end or they're back in and they're not scared of front end.  Now, there are exceptions of that, but my real answer is your front end developer, you're back end developer. Strong point of view elsewhere I see. What about strong point of view on whether you hire for the skills or are you hire for the developer and then, uh train them on the have them learn this people?  Literally don't give a fuck. Don't give a fuck about their skills at all. For good Oliver?  don't care. care that they want to do what I need them to do. but I care first and foremost about culture. second I care about intellect, third I care about skills. and it's an inverted pyramid and skills, except sometimes skill is the most important. So if I was gonna make a copka cluster and I need something cause I needed white, hyper okay. I need somebody that's very specific and a skill set.  But for the most part, when you need the generic developer, I don't care what they know. like I would go hire my guys today knowing nothing about what we're doing because I know they're a culture that they're I know their intellect. and the answer is yeah, but we're a bunch of Java and Java script and react guys. yeah, I don't care. It's a like they're computer scientists. They can figure out everything.  Yeah, well, it's a question how quickly can they learn the skill? great. I believe senior people, the answer is you can learn any computer science skill and you could do it relatively quickly.  Agreed. You can you if I pay for somebody that has that, I expect that they can do a lot more than that. But if you ask me to, okay, I have a Java I have a Dotnet expert right there who's 25 years old or I know some somebody who has never done dotnet.  He's 40 and he's had two exits and he knows what I'm gonna pick that guy. I'm gonna pick that guy all day every day. Now, price can change all that.  The answer is Jad, you only have this amount of money. cool, like that's a reason that most startup start with three or five college kids. and maybe one of them isn't even a college kid yet, because right then, all I need is enthusiasm. and I need someone that will believe for me at that point. At some point. So it'll change over time, but skills I I haven't interviewed somebody for skills for a development position, me myself in 15 years.  Now, my developer is had, but I've never in 15 years said, okay, let's mean you talk technical shop. I don't even know that. Now, I will ask them technical questions, but none of it is about me finding out about their technical skills.  It is about me giving them something that they're comfortable talking about and being able to have a conversation. Do you guys want an adverter first or do you wanna go right for the entré, or do you feel like I don't eat anything, but I don't need anything for an appetizer, but that's up to you guys. that's Nothing like to go for. What they here? ly burgers or well, figure out what you want for drunks for. all the burger here, I'm simple. I'm just to going to. Once I look at air food, it's like that solid.  Yeah, no skills now. I interview more for skills for product design, but that's mostly because since I owned them for the first time, actually I owned designed multiple times. But there I actually had to have a very specific point of view of I want this type of person that has these skills.  So I did interview more for skills there, but it was still mostly about culture. It's culture, culture, culture, culture, culture. Yeah.  So, um I think um just recently learned that, um prior experiences important, uh, like if they uh somehow managed to uh create the lack of skill in big companies for too long. and that they gained experience this way. it's only like CB based experience, if it's real it's not real. COVID had a lot more of that BS, where they just overhired so many companies. But I like I when I look at developers or product managers, um, if you worked at a big company that isn't named Amazon Google Netflix that isn't a fang a company that I respect them engineering wise?  they may still be great, but they're great as part of a machine, and you have to figure out, okay, what do I need to put around you to make you successful? And if you can't even articulate that, the answer is the world. Like I I have to do it all, because you are used to there being all the machinery of that. and especially for product and especially for design.  Those most developers, even at like a Google, they may be more senior, but they're still heavily technical. They don't go down a n nonchnical route and they're still a developer interviewing for developers in your jobs. productduct, they become administrators. They become people that are about the process, and it's like and the process the company process, not the team process.  And it's like, okay, cool, you're no longer playing the same game, so I'm not gonna say you're an idiot, and I'm not gonna say your job is useless. I'm just saying at my job and a company where I need you doing all the suit to nuts, I can't use you. Well, I mostly agree with you.  There is one exceptional. You're part of a big company, no matter how cool that company is and whether it's called Microsoft or Netflix or something, they are big. So they have this overat that we just discussed crossstin communication and also the bell curve performance review andi. that they must have.  I think it's worse or engineering, maybe not bad for fangs, but I think broad, EPM engineering, like high levels. no I can't imagine. It doesn't seem to work, well, Franks, like if they've done other startups and they've done that, then they're a well rounded person possibly that actually can articulate what's the good. what are the good things that you're doing at, there's not. It even for engineering, the right challenges, because you have your like day to day goals, for example, you work in scrum and then you have like scram bowls or whatever, because they honestly don't do scramling be companies, it's all li. and you also have a competing goalals. your yearly target goal, and they are known anyhow related to their struggles. and you somehow have to achieve both of them.  How? It's impossible. Depend on the company, so like I I worked at Amazon and I had lots of friends that worked at Amazon.  And the way you do it in Amazon is a cheap. like, there's a number that matters, and as long as you hit that number, that's all that matters, and so you you go and do all this politics. At Google, you you you quit projects. You completely quit to maximize your gearly goal, and therefore, you will you will you will leave whole projects dead.  They will have whole. So, if you were saying, you don't like the developers at those big companies either, the answer is you and I agree, you can find I am more likely to take a developer from a thing than I am a product manager, but my real answer is, I only want people that are done startups, because they don't get it, they don't they're still a lot of things behind them. But I've taken a quite a few from there and turned into something else.  I've not done that well for product and design, and I've not seen it done well with my peers at my companies that they've taken from those places, versus the developer who's been at a startup, who wants to become a product manager. I've seen a million of those turn into something good. Hello..  How are you? doing?astic.  Thank you. Have you all been in before? Yes.  Okay, welcome back. Thank you. Um, you like to get started with some drinks, maybe a half?  okay. Uh, you have some beer. I do I get a list, right?  yeah, uh I guess we're getting two old fashioned I'll take uh with Woodford. I don't know what you. No, well, what else is onap?  Um, my seasonal is going to be meanwhile, Bry Company, it's gonna be a holiday long. hasnidden you the best first. What do you usually enjoy? I go so far as bottles.  So that's like, maybe. But then we's like, like. No, go and I I could be completely judging them likely.  I no glasses for awesome. But it. If you'all care for a moment, you over to start with an appetizer, you're okay right now, but you.  I I'll get the bar to get these hard. I've I two other interactions. It like I I sat going to the rest of them during the few weeks before, because I just gone, he was lying in it. and then two, I was having trouble just interacting over King with details. and then know, I was like, okay, this, who knows why this is?  Yes. Um, and then I had I asked, uh got some questions today about helping to set up in  because they changed a bit, and I wanted to give them a shakingy jelly test that way I could do why here. that that worry about bias? I just it all the data and then I have to, please don't worry about bothering that I me.  I need your opinions something. doesn't mean that believing everything anyone says, the answer is is. and a fun. it seems backwards Neil, I' put is a productation for. about it?.times they'gn here that point. there, those crazy, here last year. in or, it is our Korean....? I... four or something., so we have the you definitely not great, but do I know this story? Okay..  We are the truest personality here. And he said definitely wait goes two jobs ago. I had a I had a fit on my team who was accused of rape by an another woman in the company. that had according to her, happened three years before. it was a day. isn't this.  And I had no wayR at the time, and so it was't there.. Oh yeah.. happening. good good.. Doesn't matter. doesn't matter.  Thank you,u welcome, sir. So, your point was a lot of people supposed to be over, the problem. We didn't have a problem with that he was running.. that we have people vaccine and alsoanda it said, I will see that before he can go see that.  He chose to beect iturt, and now everyone hurts that, now he is the about it. Okay?. Yes, in my mind.  I for that is a horrible vict for our company. no value. That's your reason. Hey, by the way, your reason could be wrong.  You could be wrong. That's your reason.. Okay., you weren't talking about a general other white chances he made.  Clearly he's statement who a wholeution. he's at least people now you take it. You weren't doing that earlier, but you're doing it now. why to go in it wasn't meagging him. You didn't it from the outside.  I know I could notice anything about it, but he also a second, that's it but that was because he wanted to bring his like some sometimes I get the let's go. here you guys.. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you be dealing with the last two weeks because hoo never gone out in the company as that as crazily as the last two weeks of my career. so.  I get a layoff, I had a million dollars worth of material, get scam from us. I could go have to and we got out of it cup. We believe in sharing will cover the whole.  We'll cover the rest of it. over. So, accomp reached that foot and I person. and said, hey, you got some littleited for sale on your site. I'd like to buy some of that'll do up.  Here's the interesting thing. One, you can't get to my marketplace unless you're a easy. So no one just saw my aluminum on my site that wasn't already.  And you have to be applusive, you can't just sign up. Two, we just got a huge from a suppier for just literally te. but I don't that the sales try to do anything wrong? Yes, you could do you?  No, huh, it is something weird. But then you put that intoiny to the on board that comes. and they throw out the people quickly, they have you on a directory number. We did all the track in them.  The key thing is, when you went through all the company and had their real news in the password. sorry, we don't, the address. They guy that they were going business now was not one of them. Well, you that. this be a person in and it was from an email address that looked very.  Now, you look really closely the answer is not the same email.. But one was like exponential, one was exponential power with a zero.. So again, of the badging, you guys knew they had better processor, but. it happened to also that we're line here.  And so we really need that so like, we were at a desperimate because we should have a million dollar difference about before we said, hey, there was a credit for. So clearly my sour leader said, let them. And so then when we finally figured out that we go power in and for what's going on, um then did, and then it was all about pig, how do we go in already a bunch of it had been like they've already taken ownership of it?  and they had already taken it to seconds They took they took coils worth $60 out and they extinguished for $5,000 per. because it was just a quick seat, and once they bought like like all the steel people who they are.. Because whether it is not or not yet shipped, 7% releed out. Of the rest of it, we found so subactive, some of it we actually found train even someplace we like went on a we actually bought that so literally this until you both didn't a piece report, but actually makes for business view and except the New York police will not get involved.  So it's like, okay, that not bad and had to get you like that. they were really to us, but I not willing to go some problem with any of these coils, but they're sitting outside. they they are they are going bad days of a lotsum, you seal of all of these metals be professional, like you. But to use it real, not are they for a control, planet control, all that stuff matter, and definitely sitting outside the elements. and went from weit from October being to this month, doing it accept that we're gonna get all of our money back. so it was bad, it would drag two weeks. It was a like I didn't have the same excom of dread that I would have had four months before, because it's like that was my money.  It was no longer buy money or I was there just helping. help me how I can help you, let me take this off of you because you guys don't need to deal with this right now. help you until the moment I'm gone. I was like? So it was a different sort of thing because I'm yeah, no.  And and we didn't close on our internal No. And when he's done in the bank, so the nobody in the bank. and we already problems is getting money in the bank, and my answer is this is another problem because now you're telling me the six million you're gonna get. we're already out 500,000 a bit. So, yeah, that'age is that a greatance of these.  So I would not I had got my entire team that for hey guys, I need to just be ready. In two weeks, the doors could just be closed. Because we're out of month.  That money comes in and that money that gets us through and the next a few dollars know, there're like there's many many movies are music, but yeah, there's. They're not they're not gonna make it, and we not make a smile would put them out of their riries and would bring up a lot of people you know okay, which is like an appetizer? fried chickens out.  Please don't have the have. Fried chicken side, no. Honey mustard dresses over. what, yeah. you remember where the else my name. look at pu.  You wanna do those with the mas potatoes? those vegetatoes now?'s all right.s what is I don't.  It's. I don't. I like I know how to do that.  I's like talking this day, people forget like, what are we doing here? How many. Yeah, no, these are I mean, listen, I's the problem, and they're horrible problem.  They have a fal problem. But they're not problems that I'm going to do is, you gotta go stick out, you have who's worth. What are their skills?  organize and then you gotta become him, hey, I have no doubt if somebody you going hey. is this day. You have too much work. So let's gonna help me hit you into this and then you can figure out how to get back.  But I can't do that yet because the answer is I can't force straight with them until there's forces straight. And I't have. And so he's not going to have a conversation with me about what have to cut when the answer is cut what, and not only that cut so blood and how you why I cut?  Don't have, we have the next. How much can you? How much can you be here?  I't I didn't say that. I asked how like you have a I can only be the United States two weeks. I have to do it like I don't know your visa, I don't know I don't know anything like that.  I' are you? I am.. But the other part of that, though, is you're in the survey box, right?  Right. Never mind, that doesn't do any good. It's not being a cultural ambassador that's there matters.  And if that was you, the answer is okay, now I know how you were gonna play this team together, but not the answer is me? Okay... And I had been told six days.  No, no, no, no. That's 45. and that's before Christmas that's I know what the offic says. what is Christmas look like? usually not necessarily a..  Oh, yeah, they had they had pulled. So yeah, so but you have a bigger hit so what I dealt with my first half my year was Christmas for me was December and the first half of January, because I had my Austin training, I'd have my coins, and then I'd have my my utert. I haven't had a berin and 10 years, but yes.  But the answer is during the holidays is it 30 30 days plus a min about was ghost town. I think it's from the first like, that week, fine. have in five days a week at the work I' rather have my in office than that week off, it's oh great.. I I'm like if the company is twin, the huge, the answer is yeah everybodyation during whatever you was doing that end of the year and. you?  the worst of the. The gay can come faster that I just dealing with a bunch of stuff together. today.. Long way away.  So you have to do a I was What do you guys like when you? how many of my people are a Monday through Thursday in the office? a one..  There's gonna be different, okay? But the thing I not in the business today was I have certain that that were told. don't have to be office except for when they and then I have certain here, like me, but they usually whatever. By the way, I wanna be enough to separate.  This is not about the. Who is that?? The product is basically at all of them. all I was tried to get the the main thing I said is who's my friend?  because then I have the other contractor problem, which is people going away for six months, where I'm like, okay, I gotta go quick that out too. Okay, but the day? the company can have whatever policy they have and we will have whatever they be the problem weviron't I don't oh, I get it.  I will have to have run awayation, but the answer is I will have a negotiation, if we have a consistent way that we just want... I will go figure that out. I will figure out how to go do it.  I was trying to figure out who I have.? I mean this is all my product is well, okay, cool. I guess I'll use that one of my rubrics for how to fix that..  I want them down.. that is the top conversation at the. That is an easy of. conversation. Are you better talking to customers?  I. I'd be surprised. You know what? Because right now, I'm worried about being listening.  And I can't listen. I know that I can't talk customers because I can't listen. I'm not empathetic and whenever they're talking and arguing with me in my head, going on I' idiot, you're a..  No, he any of you like extern average and I like having him on any excell takes notes than anyone else. if you on? I? I'm asking you, why didn't it's not Okay, so your desire is different than your. because if there is like listen, years you can talk to customers, you can write their own ticket. like that is like I don't need to if I have a ear that, that's amazing.  It so like, if that still set, maybe you should think about that a little bit and come back to me, because they could I was waiting for them to throw one to the box because my answer is, you see you some of that listen, and I don't know you're here. I mean you talk, right? No, I then why you down?  I a lot of. Cool, then why don't we do that more? You't want to know the story.  I mean, I' bored. and I guarantee I can tell yourazier more, but yeah, I mean, you're gonna make serious and not like that, like engineers, make double mistakes because the answer is you're not takes of this. That doesn't really with it stupid escap. What, some of them are stupid and have a magnes don't know that that an important thing to that comes in power...  Sometimes he writes to stop I I talk about, that, my nose open and my teeth open.' strong. Iucky likes me.. One day you'll get better at that and you'll just be clear to answer is, no, no, you know what your job isn't there and you wait until you play with it. like I look, I'm used to being pulled out, I need to go talk to the executive of this company, and I can't stand.  It's not my different, like but I had to do it. And I not do it because I answ the paper for me, do you do this? or you get it back for years.  That's a man. Again, I gotta figure out where I can put people to make people useful, and right now, I am going to get that product and I'm hoping that there's a couple of little things there that can go lifetime, you wanna go, okay, I need to do this right now. I need you to do this with.  Listen, I blow doubt of my mind because I've seen your notes and I've seen your your most of candidate... a better job it was startups are the definition of, Matt, I didn't admon as multiple times today. Who started. I mean how would you likebe.  That means something to me. means expect that you. Now, that doesn't mean they know what answer is, then there's gross. But that means something else to me.  Okay. So, you know. I don't. told me and I was like, what?  So now all of this point? I mean, scare me more than I already am. That as I told you that milk today.  I'm here. So started. I barely started it, but I did have teams for two weeks. on the hits and ready to start, and then we were finalizing not.  Okay. lot of way bigger, way bigger, way bigger. like the fact that they're part in with us that I looked at ever going, good sales guys because they sold something that I don't seem represented to the team. Doesn't it wasn't there before? I doesn't mean it wasn't like I but I would say me and the five more that's, no general football all is too long a lot of our land.  I wasn't. I better with you I don't know. So, let's the time I met you. the amount that they throws himself on the bus and ti on the sore, it just keeps happening. avo to know how rare that is, cause I don't have anything he real founder, like, I can get some honestly after nothing.  I can I Nathan to peel performing, like he and he can help really that like your mother of like like you found it on your sword about it all. It'. My point to you, my point is more dumb of hey guys, I've worked with the answer is that has not a fucking fault.  I'm okay, I go. one point. one of my books that make all the man read.. Yeah, is in my house when I got there, I was like, that's interesting. I haven't brought my books in yet, so like, that's my books in my library.  Yeah, I was trying to come down.. and we're but the timing that work they, they come out and I was on the floor. that bring their handles down. Wot their wives and my wife and friends and dis Wait wait, wait wait, your wife is friend with Dr. William? mine, yeah, I mean, we just so so long. it was I turned this lot of stories because the answer is, I got you and Brett tonight, whereas like, oh, you know, Brett also interesting.  And now you and Daco in is like,erson thing. a bunch of you just you know, you meet people on the way, standard, but I just thought something else. I hope you figured out as dates, but I think that out. I love the book.  I love the book. Make all the man you read it? I can tell you, 24 20 years like I off I'm not.  I feel like? I' here... Yep. and I'm like, you know, afterwards Even afterids like that, I sort of I don't your executives that too they do the right?  answer for that hour down.. I the math? the answer is is, but then you have to power to the, whatever the people do, I hope you have more important to do, you have a different problems.  Oh, great, like you have more, otherwise, you can't sell this. I can't sell this. you can't sell this. So the nurt is you win.  I need definitely their job, but we need to do our balance. It's you can't think about what we're doing, the answer is, hey guys, we pretend by 10 I mean somewhere between five and 20th, and you guys could take it out after. because I' don make sure that I think. I' no excuse him.  I'm not excusing him, but the answer is, I need him to play his form. Now, for you, the answer is yeah, you need to be able you. not of you to look you and do the same sort of thing. And that's because you're founder, you know, you you you believe the right color.  You get here forever. It's so I hope you believe that color right. They go. look. coming this hour to another. but when we can find things started out well, they were less their part.ower or what whatever, you believe it go.  Okay, that size is landed the same time. we did have the. Now the second year, if you fire some more on those things, we want the in, when you started having more more. Yeah, started saying like o'clock man.  I mean, I mean, I get it. I get it and say. I'm gonna solve that pot.  I'm gonna going real quickly. back. get it. no. I my entire job is just a particular. and it's the most annoying thing English. and then have to close over and over and over again. That's just part of the thing.  I hate it here.. but it is what it is. But I know that about and the answer is, and especially the more remote it is, the more you have to be that, the more.. I I'm I'm going fuck you over that, because really answer is me and some of those people are gonna have to happen, you guys a list. we're gonna have to have a serious arch.  Here's the easy for one. me pop me figure out what I need to make you. but let's. I know what I use. you can't that... file isn't who we need to eat because we need. I'm asking you to be.  You are the ones you can't afford to lose and you're the one that you lost that couldn't appear to needs. And why they not., where is her writing? okay, I'll hold it on the top of my head, so?  Yeah yeah, out of um out of the people that I don't think they can you to lose so it's probably what? you be smeared off, probablyyom from received um. Iacahu, and those are the bugs that I knew for to work. um maybe it will give them my do up make stop list, but I don't even know him as well, and so it's hard for me. yes, it's always a reasonably sure I had already put him on my list, but I put it explain that I didn't know it was probably.  And then the other um one that's a little bit different, it's not age, it's it's like the two experienced dev os in t years, which are Alexaleiana and Okinataya, that became they may be ca a problem, but you can't use them both at the same time. I'd like how you're taking them about it, when you keep thinking about it this way, because you're giving the optionality, because the real answer is, we need to hire a badass get an ox person in Austin ASAP.. but yes.. and I did the same thing.'s so afraid that she going to be her face to hear me and I was like, I answer me in and I was like, I promise you what. Like we' doing because I boss was this, it cost us a lot of time. we're gonna go give him what he wants and at the end of the day, I get to watch you guys gonna be multiple times tomorrow, and that's exactly what I want.  I wouldn't do it tomorrow which is a couple weeks now, but the answer is definitely no they're here or there, there. Well watch it tomorrow is not gonna be here. Oh, no, good point.  Yeah, right. I don't more more heating you have?. And that's why it's not the way that I can do it it it's wrong.  B it costs me a day, and every day, by the morning is all turning so it cost me half a day. Now it costs any time. It costs all of the time. trying to minimize. my point is as long as you wanna break Danny is like your job and your own like standing here.  I can promise you, this is a note. If somebody comes in and a room, and we're all like, I understand how looking and they' actually I was wrong. You rock, like, like this is amazing.  You right though we probably no, but actually, what I'm taking tomorrow is giving, because I read your guys into do notes. And they are voluminists. You guys can amazing notes.  You take notes almost better than my robot takes notes, almost. You're note is hard to find the robots. Do you what your guys no go.  And the reason I think they're thorough is I. I know what goes in the district stri life, so I can imagine these interviews that I was in where I was reading these notes. There's lots of notes. L lots of notes, not sure we read the right thing.  I don't think we're asking them the right question. possible, but I don't know. I was like I got I got a lot of data there, you know. especially for product.s product that I highly confident for not asking in the right class.ight. good? But I'm also not sure that we're at we were introduced for the right job.  But based on the job description and based on the interviews, there's a mismatch. then as I bring in what I see from what I see as problems, there's another mismatch. So my answer is cool. I don't think we're lyinged on what we're hiring for when we point because this is not there.  Because if we're not, the answer is you are doing your best. You are doing your best. but we're not doing it as a team because you're smarter to gather than you are apart and with me, you're smarter. you're a smarter. So let's just align on a stage.  But not tomorrow. what we gets way way faster and closer through that. don' each other well enough yet. M something that really do a very, great job and making sure that things that are clean out for the clean up. And if things are specifically so between us, clear that easy, okay?  I don't think this is saying in between us that they talk about. is it? how do you feel about what's going on in Tbia? We have to move a bunch of condition Ber here.., yeah, yeah, yeah. looks like about we can distracted altether it's about me or you..  I don't know which. I just I I don't know well enough yet there. I'm going to always default people more open with my. because you have a better data, makes you make better decisions. but clearly there's always thought I have to know what he actually cares about and right now I don't know he could be you literally said if I tell you something, you know what, we need to go have.  He and I are alive and it's not because we and I got alive. That's the quickest and best way to success. Now, how we get there isn't it entirely different story, let alone the roadblocks along the will and fuck that up.. about who says what you that glo one of you tell him.  Yeah. The covered armor will rush into the rock. We have 1847.  We be the four that he is in York that we cannot be York which is in contractor. Somehow, we have been that everyone is like Russian? He's not gonna be a contractor at some, the to pay all the difference.  Cool. The only difference next time here I will have a put in America that I will be Correct. When I do, the answer will be I will. in the the government will see their investors, the back then?  reason what I learned today is I have a Halifax shop. I get. I don't wanna ask anybody to say like type of that.  I'm not losing. that's the that whole thing.. What's option I'm gonna give that finality as opposed to a reasonion. There's option for this, so let's go figure these out together. what the real reason look like the real reason that the other in on the. developers or a different. almost get a physical fight now they cannot show up the workers have they say.  Hey, they can three devout people of the. Okay, six. What?  Okay, cool two, right? I don't care what this job is. what they tell you is. Okay. the real reason why I work all war maybe like two weeks down of the line discussing that whatever do those rest.  And when it body, actually decided how clean. he told that. So who's the ashole that? I, because people. bottomow it gets.  For people from history did not. This is I was the fire myself and I went in there and afortunately my in the time. was gonna fire and that't. No, what?  I one back down with the classroom rations, but uh, why am I not fired tomorrow?. Cool. we have a bunch of cops, little Orew. I get it..  Cool. but I need to make sure that people who are comfortable home their life and home their right. and directly causing the problems run theleheads falling the size as what by the problem look at his phone from.. But what you're telling me if he is an anti man, either every way, what of you? Yeah.  I think there's no good reason. It's inertia and the people that some of the people that might be involved in the decision of firing them would be directly the people I would happen to become the slack, cool on the cool. Let me uh let's let is this is I'm speaking out loud.  I'm not telling I'm I'm just thinking about. Why do I not fire him tomorrow? Why do not put a meeting this tomorrow and I fire him?  Well, I'm not trying to do this as a as a I'm a strong big man. I'm trying to see this day, hey, uh, this is a completely fucking and I have enough like right now, heartless. I have I'm a black heart.  I can do anything right now, but I's so cool. I don't wanna walk in like I don't. I wanna go figure out.  Can I go it's so I don't feel how much access of Alexander God compared to the rest of our lives. If I ask you to go home right now and like come back in two hours and tell me how he turn them off and give it it depends on what it is that he's access to. I would say that we just figure out if it's a robber or not, it our or two.  I need to make a note because at a minimum, the answer is, I gotta go figure out how we can afford anybody, because the answer is as it should go off, someone's fine, and I know what that means. Yeah, The problem is with the yield up opposation ear, because they' like the total amount of stuff they have keys in the kingdom. They have they have everything.  Oh, right, exactly. Alexander, could have that okay. yeah, and if he does if that means we have to like rotate all the keys to all of our systems, then it's a bit more of a pain buff. Well, even if she does, that's how I can use it.  It doesn't matter, it's too much rest there and has to be shut off.. it still has to be it shut off. I use music. The company at Rus had a lot of like I had all the keys, all the keys to all the kingdoms. making sure, like that's the reason that took me two months to unwite myself is let's make sure this isn't a big deal.  Let's put a team in place, da dip. and it took two months. cause I had all the keys. probably half more. How. How many less here because they probably don't have other CMO system. like I had every system I had access and an. so gotta take it out how you can out for people as quickly easily and all play blah blah block. because the fact that you guys may I need buy a buy a phone and my own computer today, but we can't turn off a De person.  He's we actually have our priorities mixed up because that guy has all the kids and that's scary stuff. wild goose. loud dude. well played. well played. well played, well played, well played. when we have it all there. And until then, it will be just other things. And it's it gets better all the time, I'm there.  But this scene, I believe, has a experience in not getting anything to be done. So I see a version one, oh, you see a version 1.5, but without a change in the scene, it never becomes the thing that it eats the promise that you put. that's you forget about a face... all levels, even don't all them so they keep., in the problem, once you six months later, like three months ago, you that it's gonna be six months later. I can. but no product owner, they found an I saw from you today.  I couldn't get you to give me a bullet points. No product owner is going to prioritize your work at. I have a work...  I agree, but you said that wasn't a good one. Okay, but therefore, I I'm not gonna get theoubt you you can't convince me that one should do this holistically. Now, it's the best of it' it's better than your the cook thing.  The physical thing, like, it's working good. I don't. replacing game would be where it's like the same stuff has no stuff. behind. Maybe it has more, but no one cares. you have to have to have to qualified. here, but. don't.  I understand. I know. I also understand the uh compounding. ethical, like it you start on boarding elord.  We know we can lay on down. So the Ori restart nowhere what we use that the trial project. better for us. that is. adopts that thing and use doing.. I presented this feet. long.  Yeah, but I think that this kind ofries to fall with the eliminated domain, and he ad makes lots more sense to attack it across olderains at theuse at the actual engineering culture. I don't understand the power growing up, there are some technical difference. When I break down in my head, what better pocket, okay?  I know we don't have a full monrosor's left after, but we don't have a a monolithy. We have a hybrid semi we have a services architecture. Well, it Okay?  So we have let's maybe say uh how big the thing is how it being the dig. and personal microservice which only the store something and as three it will be the smaller. we have everything in the. We have a. That's the one. one of those other ones. ten. that's this thing worked with just a single customer. with several customers in the old customers.  And we have both. We have all. So we have that work with one, we have W that can work with smell. and the MVD and then W assessments can work with all. have all three. how many other excess we have like?  couple more. Agreed. So if it's a big but that is I haven't got to I don know nothing about the solicit by this.  If we have that if we have if we have NYM dimensions of the problem, the fact that you're gonna give me a one size means, it's not, but my problem is, you're selling it as it's it solves a lot. My answer is, I bet if we actually break it down, we break it down into our our ben diagram. The answer is no, the dig digits it, and then I all of a sudden that that that mess they see it is very small. how much I don't don'toud of the world that they have because they have alic and there's but explosive kind of.  And all of them are really small. so they play how they ship with the only ship fast they have the front of theide, total number of c trying. total number and shippers for year, high number., particular team your teams are it's a huge range in terms of teams that shit fast. and those usually are new products. Once the thing is actually used to keep fast TV. So we are on the same.  No, uh those solutions that the teams we need leverage to going to stack, not in entirely better completing one of those things IBM on that they're in the same. There is a few sacks and there's always a somebody who listening English, what the but there's yeah, is that one stack what's call it 10 sacks for two thousand developers, ten stacks is still a small number. That's pretty amazing. but the answer is still, that's still a hard problem.  It is it is a hard problem, and the thing is that we try for emulate that Michael from that I think.onsense, let's put boundaries there. Let's actually means like all of those microerv so that they all walks of the same is, they all have the same sex animals. They all are al alive.  But have it from. way easier will be to just raise thisots which it has the val which has its own little and so, just put allations ofigrations there, you regularly more whatever the transport there and the only struggle I have with that. Let's assume I I am granting you that the class of the I don't know that. I just I don't it is.  My only feeling that is I know of this many integrations we have to do in the next 12 months. But remember, I don't want you to think anything more than six. know what? Yep.  I really have We're on the same page. So the PNC list, that's why I wouldn't talking to have any day, I was like, I need to make sure I understand your list, I changed it upira, I changed up thisummy. No, I you.  I changed some jellyfish. that way I can see all these things so I can see you done to these things because they're still a small number of issues that are in this. I still don't believe that this is no this. I'm looking forward, especially because I know in Vera, there is four things that have PNC.  There is Horacine PN must have, there's PNC Shawn says must have, by the way, this is different. PNC uh, nice to have. um, so I like cool. I'm only looking at the bus hat right now.?  Cool. And that number I'm like that cream. but um, okay. let go. Uh, three years ago that afterando and producer theara one of the oldar was not integration, it's simple not exactly the we are now the's here. product in definitely.  I love them. It's the best way to run a piece. I it is the best way to run a product in here because all that matter.  I don't want you to talk about to me about the fucking bits and bites. That's the fucking number you trying to hit guys. I' quiet as soon as it is from.  Goas easily is the speech soard and developers a great a great a great, a great, great, agree. Now we have to like our stories are how we we like code leads up to ger tickets, whatever you wanna call those things, geera tickets are business value. code is no business value.ics should encapsulate business value and those things up say and if I can't look at us they go why are we doing that? And I can tell me how, what which are those numbers are it moving?  I was saying is that we had OPR and we kind of about that. and we had that makes some.. There is an inter there. diagrams. it was like this.. Again, this a lack of leadership. it was a lack of leadership.  So agree that is a leader's job to be able to translate to the engineers and the product people here's how what you are working on leads to this new customers, this main existing like that's how we're doing. Now, that's always a bet from us. It is the executive team going, hey, you said you need 500 of these.  I'm gonna feel this thing, this thing, you think something gonna be 500? Okay, now guys, here is what to be. 3 500, we back 500 these come from this thing. I need you to build this thing.  It'd be a morbage. I like. that's that's what I want. We will get the right one. believe.  I developers and on keyboard lineing code the most important metric outside of my okay office. is the developers writing code. I need their means Ine. Now we're at about.  And I haven't seen such like I don't know. I put back into the numbers based on the I wish I wish we had Google as it was microphone, because jellyfish still hasn't created the calendar thing or. That tool that I'm telling you about also integrates the calendar with their gear ticket with that they'aneous.  Well even if there're spontaneous, they put the caliber. Agreed. the answer is it starts with two caliber. butealousy, it will better say that this day is It doesn't right now because it doesn't support Microsoft and for Google, the work that we're not gonna get. Yes, but it's only they only have the things written., no, I can look at it and I can do my own analysis versus they're so hum.  All that they't think you mean, but they're not on their calendar?. as you want to zero. is it and he might swim, hold on. Again.. Now, I realize it's a broad brush. you don't need that one othercept.  You mean that agent.? I am. What you're doing it.  He' what what seems doing? What's it what's he doing? listen, you can tell me, you baby says to these people and just us. okay?  yes, okay, but I spoiled bit. Was it me? I like strippers, and looks like spoiling kids. no, how do you spoil kies and they can without how do you how do you?  I how I spoiled?ions, and we no longer want to be. We want to say all of ourions.  What? table. I' saying in a bottle.  I just challenge you with you guys a bathroom you guys, hold on. Let me change these words. Why are you fighting him on?  And this that's a good question. I was my last day in Serbia. I actually had his.  I had a conversation with you and it was too late. so I couldn't do that. Okay, wait, you are. I had okay, okay. so tell me why I'm not waiting for my mom to get back and I'm gonna call Danielle on the way home. and I' say, Danielle, and you should send me up a meeting with Alexander and what's his name?  it is? Wait, hold on. I don't want you not to be excited about this.  I don't know you well enough yet so I don't know whether this look is yes, you know, please keep going because I'm not giving you the angry look. or it's you're not part of this. Like he what's funny is he seems, but there is seriously something he's like, you you you're like you're not saying anything. I don't know what that means right now..  I mean I I I it's one of the most part I'm not part of this like, uh, you know. I'm obviously in favor of hiring the guy. My only asterisks are I don't want to deal with any uh annoying fallout from it at the. hey, you're CPound.  Guess what? Shit rolls up Bill, you're fucked. See now now that shit goes up your fucked, now what do we get?  Uh Probably tired of on white. Wednesday and we forgot to drive with him to get ouruss around? Okay.  Cool. Tomorrow I need you to figure out and get our ducks in a route. My goal is I'm gonna fight with him on Wednesday.  I'm gonna go to the office tomorrow. I'm gonna talk to Daddyell. and the unless Danielle tells me something crazy, by the way, tomorrow, you can walk in the morning, you could walk in the morning, you could walk in the morning, you can go, oh my God, this is fucking crazy. We're all drinking last night here. shut up.  They cool.. he would come on the plan. How do we knock the fuck if you do this?. I'm in the.  And then, are you getting ideas for the team? We're is not helping us to pay. Ab, it's literally managers like whipping up equal against the company is literally opposite a man.  Like, I'm sorry, I kid it. if you're gonna like, go like unionize, I get it, but you're no longer a man kid anymore, you are employed. strong person to all those. Yes, he yeah, listen to this part. That's right. over those 12 months... still there. and one. we have three.  So you're gonna give me these names tomorrow, so that can call them tomorrow, and I be like hey, hey, I you doing? Why don't you introduce myself? I haven't talked to the team yet when name Chad.. really in fucking impulting me, okay?  I need to make sure you're good. you need these three names because I'm gonna call him and you like, hey, guys, I need to make sure you're good, because I have up number one., are working. Okay. okay. I want to keep.  Last question. We'll figure that the ad all these things. I have all these of my morning with spring, how important is spring, new pretty with.  Good morning is going be, uh. That's why I'm asking... I'm not asking to move.  I'll try to figure out is, okay, so I only have to 11., so I may to talk to some devops people. I'm only talking to this guy, whatever, and but I've been saying like, my mornings except for Thursday where I'm actually out in the morning and the afternoon, the answer is, mornings are all training. So, I can't change it.  There's one of the present in my what's his name? you guys go? can't be tomorrow...  So, okay. don't want your things tomorrow, but this isn't it. I won't make decisions tomorrow. It sounds like Wednesday's the day that I can possibly make these. probably should be in the guy who stick is the guy we need.. but unless you still play thisip. get?  what happened on the hope that's developed place like nice, lost. What does that mean? What was our hustles for?  everybody? Yeah? Well?  No. what? ands or whatever reor for. They knew, so some of those things andaring that, and at some point in currently to something that they do nothing and just.  So he's spoiled all of them now he's gone, they will do nothing. So, here's my bike. I don't know what a devout means. because they should be part of the team that's the delivery is that deliver is secret from now. and therefore and therefore, like, for instance, we brought about like um nobody knows when something went out, there's no goodility that's insan.  Okay, no, every company everybody. like like we are sensible now. like everybody. and cool, like the problem is is the people that over here that have to do like I make the server and I put the stuff up, cool. Then there's whatever that like deliver the top. No, no.  I't going to be the thingoon this. and they care about the same thing. Okay, because it's so in the last ten years for sure. I've only had one Jbox person that was dedicated period in ten years.  Now, at setitas, I had three one three.. I'm not. I'm I'm that.. what you have seen?  They may not fall with blowing up. Yeah, but Alexander doesn't., if he's treating the team completely different and divorced from actually customers and his most important customers. and making it so that they do their jobs cheaper, faster, better, is how he is incent box. Can he get there?  can we incent the ice in to run and see breakfast? you were going. I will make this.  This is the easiest. I want like this will scare and I will need you guys' help because I'm gonna come in. I'm gonna be that guy.  I'm what I'm not gonna do is say he said he said he said, he answered me.. Just let you know? The other way would make it easier for me to be better at lunch.  Had you done it before and I come in, you're right.. Thank you. Everybody else?  The good news is is Libbyension. They'll be like, oh my God. I don't want anyone scared for their job because the people that are scared for their job, I don't care if they're skipping their job, the people that aren't scared for their job that are scared for their job of them that I don't.  But as soon as I fired this first person guys, everyone's walking around and fucking needles like that. And I'd only be saying that but the answer is I literally a what we're doing. that the only is like jumping on a grenade, because I'm like, guys. this guy seems insane. Why't he around?  for bad reasons? Let's see it is. Otherwise, no, this is all of our life works because my entirety art right. as soon as I get started..  Okay, we' you're gonna go you're gonna go your list and you're gonna go give me a list. We're gonna talk about that list. And when I have that list, then well go into what I go do.  I gotta go figure out how to go.... Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate the day.  Yeah, I don's fun. out there.. Napkins. I'm.  I want you, I. Sports again?. No one. I listen, I watch MMA, that's my only sport I watch.  I did because it was on Netflix and I want Netflix more of it, so the answer is but it was horrible. So they didn the streaming it like I could not watch. Correct. the street look but streaming is different, like a lot like they have a lot of technology they have to.  And so I hope no one got tired. because because I watched people. No, I don't think so. And the reason here is my I watched the the Joe Rogan comedy specials, the last one was last did locked.  So that was their first four Rgan who let's go to the fly thing, okay? Now, Mike Tyson's bigger thanilo, okay? However, next year, they have the NFL.  Now with that, next year, they have the J WE. the NFL this year. Oh, so Christmas. games. Christmas Day Christmas.  Where do I go to get you? we're right.. They have the WE starting in January.  Okay. So they have to figure out this livestock. So the only reason someone is to get fire is because the answer is they knew it was a test, okay?  Because there's no doubt in mind, either, this was the biggest colossal fuck up we've ever seen. or the answer is, no, no, they they were finding out some things. I believe they were finding out something because again, I respect Netflix engineering culture. I think they have a month to find out how to figure it out I don't know how they're gonna do it in time because I could not watch the main event. the fact that you know, those NFL games will draw on a lot of, I don't how.  How do you think they're gonna get that? So, the answer is at least if so they're that good, they know all their problem. Sorry, they know all the ones that were level one and level two problems.  So they know them all now. and they have a million engineers. So I wouldn't bet against Netflix. but I do know that streaming something where here's a video that I'm streaming and I go to end number of people is different than alive thing that goes to all. So, it's a different technology, there's something they have to learn here.  I'm not going 18, you you can't. Go ahead, go here, go to and go over the three, yeah. Or not here, but uh go to um 45 and then 45, and then 183, you're in the second..  So, um, yeah, what do you think on RNef in this conversation? Um, so, uh I'm pretty sure I need to fire this guy. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I needed to fire this. so so that is the the craziest thing I'm telling you right now is I'm gonna come in and fire this guy.  What age? Um, that's crazy, because as long as we can get us stuff shut off so we can do it, that would be good So, I gotta get so I'm there's a lot that I'm worried about with him. So that's the craiest thing I I could definitely see him causing us problems.  Yeah, no. this is why I'm man, I yeah, uh like Sorey at one point in time also called him what the uh psychotic. Wait. Yeah.  Okay, um, the circey had very poor judgment. He doesn't have the best judgment, because I'm looking at he's great with customers though. He is great with customers, but, he was sitting there standing up for this guy. sorry, that's not fair.  He wasn't standing up for this guy. He was standing up multiple. he would just sell the like he's the guy's bad. He says the guy's bad, when he interviewed him and he said he is, anyone that he interviews and says this is good fit, it's normally tough to get him to admit that, he was wrong.  Yeah, I didn't see him until you pulled away off slow, so. yeah, so, Serey I find interesting. Serge I mean, you even hurt like you were you were paying attention. They were not.  I was fishing for him to reach out to product there. Please tell me something. Because I was like, okay, cool.  Like they're telling me you're good at product. I don't think I have any good product. You, but he doesn't want that.  He doesn't want it all. So it's like, okay, well that's not a thing. Because again, I'm trying to figure out what he's good at, right now, I don't know what he's good at. at all. at all.  I know that um are he in tell brothers? And I don't mean that for real. I mean, are they either don't get along that well, all the. but here's what I can tell you about circuit.  We're Serating like when we brought on spoil clips and any of these partnerships, he can do an amazing job at that part. What does that like a solutions engineer type. you know what I mean? he's better than any solution engineer I've seen than any other company.  So, there's stuck he's very good at. and he actually is very good at productic stuff, too., he just doesn't like it. Okay. Han is as well.  But I think with a man at least I can see his coat. So, like, I I I can evaluate a so Ivan clearly communication is not his best thing.. That's an engineer. like that's not an engineer.  That's nothing there. You're gonna go right here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. but Ivan, so far, I don't know if anything that I have disagreed with Ivan saying a word.  If he says something yes, if he says something, it is more than likely been my preconceived notion already, and I've been careful going, is he just picking up on me and there like, he doesn't know that. so, so far, I am yeah, but ahead and get on that. and then you're gonna go what. so far, I'm like, I'm starting to trust when you give me an opinion, it's only an opinion in certain areas, and that opinion happens to be something that I think the same thing. unless he agrees with you.. he doesn't abide by any social means there. He will never lie to you. He is gonna tell you exactly how it is.  Okay. Just so you know about and sometimes it's, but he's never gonna tell you anything that's not true. Yeah, last week, every road in this town was on in construction.  Everywhere I returned, and I was like, what is going on? And I was down. I mean, every same thing seems like it was in in in and almost did in in construction, so yeah, Sey is a interesting work.  So, he said something to me today. Tell me what he means by this. Quote, I had your job seven years ago until I did something unaccept and I went what are you talking about and he went answer that.  What does he mean? He never had your job, and I don't know what he meant by doing something unacceptable. Yeah, I found it weird also.  I was like, I don't know what to do with this, but I'm gonna have to ask somebody now. and um I don't know what He said it in front of Ivan, and I looked at Ivan, and I was like, uh he never had your job, but I don't know what. I mean, he' not he's never been good with dealing with people. So he's good with dealing with customers, horrible people in the organization. especially women, which is not good..  Serey also? Yes, not too extensive aope, or, hold. can you tell me more about a loaf? So a had complaints from four different people in the office that are female.  Okay. and we are we doing north now? Yes, we are. I turn around.  We' out. And including, um what was he hitting on them? No, he just got them to tears, so he like, like got them to tears.  How? being asshole? Yeah.  Okay, not trying to be an asshole. I don't think he're trying to be an asshole, he just didn't know how to deal with woman, you know what I mean? but you don't think it was something that was specifically like, he wasn't sexual harassment. was it was he was just a gruff, gruff guy, and that's count indicated with most women and their okay, exactly. okay.. agree, you need to get rid of them, but different than dipper than not.  Sergeey, same thing? Serey's not to that extent, but yes, the same thing. So, my history that's, uh, my issue in Europeans.  Yeah, it is. Easterastern Europeans are much worse than that. Okay, you go left and just turn around, yeah.  Yeah, the answer is it's it's I always find it a weird culture, like they are very open and very yes, but at the same time, it's also like it's it's a lawsuit wouldn't happen. agree. Okay, so that's Serey is just gonna be he's very opinionated gonna tell you how it is. yeah, I I I actually had uh drinks uh Alexi was my first developer in Ukraine and he actually just moved to the United States with his pipe. I had drinks with him two weeks ago. and I'm sitting there drinking with him and I will still never forget he's I'm sitting at a happy hour with him and my recruiting team. because my recruiting team just gatrew this great, I took him all out, and he looked at the recruiting, you, you is so.  You're your. I'm like, what are you talking about? That what you're you're you're like, dude, I don't know what what are you saying to her?  I don't know your what you oh, stop, dude, stop. I' like, you can't do that. So, uh yeah, and I had to deal with the situation, cause, uh both ofon and Seri made one of the people at the office cry lately.  Ivan, too. Oh, not just that, though, but this person is on the product team and they were also made to cry by our customer and by a female colleague, too, so help a brother out, because I'm fucked. This person's like I have to walk around eggshells with this person.  I would say yes. Okay, cool. Help me help my brother out, please..  Okay, haven't met her yet. I only met her over uh cause I'm like, okay. yeah, it's just, uh I'm like, I'm not gonna fire the whole company just because you're crying all the time, you know what I mean? I'm like, I can't do that.  And is she a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday? Is that why I didn't see her today? Okay.  Cool. Thank you. At least I know who to I can an shut around.  Yeah. but I think a lot of it is more the tears turn on when she's not doing her job. So what I have found is most people when they are not successful for whatever reason successes, the answer is everything else is, because I can understand at the answer is, I come in every day, I work my ass off and nothing gets done here and I don't understand what to do. If you're 25, 28 years old, you don't know what to do.  But this is why startup people are different. Yeah, cause start of people are like, I don't need you to tell me to do. Give me the big give show the show me the mountain.  Yeah. So, that one you'd have to be very careful with on that end, too. And again, the problem is I'm the CEO, so I never see the stuff, you know what I mean?  So I've just heard it, and I'm like, okay, Danielle. And at some point in time I'm like, okay, well, yeah, you know, is it everyone else or, you know what I mean? It's Yeah, but you have to make things like different beast where you yeah.  So, you didn't respond to me today. You haven't introduced me to the te, like, there a thing came out today, which was the relative Chad, but you haven't introduced me to the team at all. No, I want to introduce you to the team whenever you're ready.  I know you're going through training, normally I'd introduce you to the full team after you're done with training. sounds if you want to do it more then, that's. I I plan on doing training this week, so let's plan on Monday of next week and let's do it. And then, cause that way I'm not I'm not interrupting like, I'm may say something to people and say I need something of like, next week is when I'm gonna be like, okay, I wanna watch these things.  I wanna see these things, show me you guys doing these things. I'm gonna start changing these things. Yeah, cause normally we don't introduce anyone in the company, until after the training zone so that they can get up and running or learn things, understand things. kind of observed before.  But you've been announced on that normal team channel, but actually having the phone call with the team go. If we're gonna do something off pushing your training back, then we can change that, but I don't think we're not the answer is, yeah, you gotta know the software inside and out, too. I'll I'll handle what I have to around it, maybe I'll guess 20 minutes or whatever, but Yeah, the Alexander Sin at the point, I don't think he helps us.  Um, it is clear you don't, and it's clear they don't also, and that's what's freaking me out on surfette, is these are I I keep giving Seri easy questions. and it keeps making them very complicated. And my answer is, what are you doing, dude? Like, like you think this guy's horrible?  You think this guy' sucks? You can't even like, I get it. You're like, he's keeping the the I I'm not there and I everything seems to be that way with that.  I'm like, what are you doing, dude? Uh, take the take the wind. So.  Well, the other question is, is how do we do it to, you know, because I think there's some other people in that situation, like, Arcadian, some others that I'm wondering if we wait and do that together. I I wasn't thinking about that ahead of time. um, and I should have because I know at least one other person that being the STM. So, maybe I don't go completely crazy and do what on Wednesday, but the answer is my daughter is figure it out, figure out anyone that needs to go and then do it all at once so that you're not an asshole forever, you know what I mean?.  That's my only concern with you doing if right away. We've already hung onto them and paid them way too long, bringing negative value. At this point in time, I think we need to make sure he shut off properly and if we're gonna do it and there's others, do it all at once, you come in and you're an asshole for a short time. and then you can build a trust back up quickly way.  If you're doing it all along, you know, then it's gonna be a bop more problematic for us to run. The only reason that I was moving fast kids, it seems like this guy, so, the word I will use at my team is cancer, and if there's cancer in my team, I will nuke it. I would agree in his cancer.  And that's the only reason I'm trying to move fast is it seems to me this guy is if it wasn't for survey, for some reason, never wanting to just be like, yeah, get rid of him. He says everything that is, get rid of this guy, except for get rid of this guy and I'm like, I don't understand, man. but that's the only reason I was like, I need to kick you in a habit of like, let's go fix things and move fast, but move fast. move, dude. Yeah, and he's gotta stop preventing things like this, so if you like to bet, what am I gonna put him on?  Where is he gonna be in three months? What's he gonna be doing? So, I think he does bring a lot of strength on the architecture on that Ivon doesn't, right?  So, Ivan just so you're aware Avon likes living in the past. Um, and Serge does like moving to the future. and does have a lot of strong ideas. He doesn't have the ability to move them forward just because of he doesn't know how to deal with people, but if I had to bet on a solution most times be whether it was was Ivan or surgonite, I would bet on circey solution.  Interesting. cause my one day some summation is the opposite, and it's to meon wouldon's why we're still in the desk. I and I've heard that from you lot of scared. Like, I I I I haven't seen that yet, but I've heard that from you.  Like, Sara gonna try like hell to get us on the micro service avantad tooth and nil. So, Ion so far at least understands, like, it seems like Sey likes to paint the pretty picture of where things will be and not talk about how we get from here to there is at least very, very, very comfortable with okay, wait, we have a lot of times he tries to stop the progress. there I haven't seen that today. I understand what you're saying. based on what you've said, I can see that.  So Sarate does bring a lot to the table in then it. Serey doesn't always get the buying and the and he doesn't he can't always explain things in the right way. But he does know our systems, he does know what he's doing.  And as far as coding he can do it well and he can build stuff, especially with other solutions and like, he can do prototypes well and he loves doing it. So here is an interesting test and me telling you about this test and then stop sign sort stuff like, you're gonna go right up and there'll be a um an arm ramp. There'll be a turning in sorry. um I have given Serge a million feelings that I judge developers by coderit today.  My plan is to keep doing that to not tell him one way or the other. I'm looking for him to show me something. um cause he hasn't been going. Yup, hasn't.  That doesn't mean that he has been doing the wrong thing. he just hasn't been. And I'm trying to left here, please. I'm trying to understand what his skills are.  And, you know, he talks me about process and you're like, no, stay away from that. I'm like, cool. but it I don't need people to draw a pretty pictures. I need pretty pictures and then something else.  So, right now I'm like, okay, cool. I I've told you that I'm looking at my developers encoding. I'm going to get in the right hand lane. you're gonna get.  The only way you're gonna get what you want on a survey, though. directly say, this is what I need you doing right now and I can't have you doing. It's the only fair way to do it. Right now I'm trying to figure out do you pick up what I'm putting down, or do I always have to be completely explicit?  then you're not senior. and after this, the next the next street after this sign right. You're right here... cause, yeah, I don't believe you that like, leadership needs to be there so I can tell you guys you guys want to go do. and I can say, here's what we're doing, here's how we're doing it. Cool.  And Ivan is amazing. And then left at the next light. Yvon's not gonna lead people.  No. There's there's he does he is very clear about that. and this personality you left right here. So I think we need to senior developers here that people there..  And I don't think we have one right now. I haven't met so I don't heads of engineering, like the heads of the development team, yep, we need somebody else. And they're right here.  I appreciate the right home. Again, I'm gonna bring it at the I. Thank you. Thank you for your first day.  I appreciate it, my man. I will see you tomorrow. coming for dinner and have fun at home and see you tomorrow morning. Yeah.  I'll be there at the south. What's the matter? Sheila that writers.  I Alexa turn onation. You put something else over there. Thank you.
