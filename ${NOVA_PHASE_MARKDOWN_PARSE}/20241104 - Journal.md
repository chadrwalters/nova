# 20241104 - Journal

Let me analyze this journal entry and provide a structured transformation with historical context and insights.
## Refined Thoughts
This entry reveals significant organizational challenges within the BookedBy team, focusing on several critical issues:
	1.	Communication Barriers
	* 	Severe delays in response times (6-24 hours for basic information)
	* 	Disconnect between communication preferences (email vs Teams)
	* 	Distributed team causing coordination challenges
	2.	Project Management Issues
	* 	75% sprint carryover rate
	* 	68 concurrent epics with minimal progress
	* 	Poor prioritization (12 epics marked as "major" or "critical")
	* 	Urgent PNC release for January 15th lacking clear requirements
	3.	Team Stability Concerns
	* 	High turnover (25 people in 12 months)
	* 	New leadership across key positions
	* 	QA team recently rebuilt
	* 	Only 4 developers with >2 years tenure
## Key Insights
	* 	The situation appears to be a classic case of organizational drift with insufficient controls
	* 	Critical lack of alignment between key stakeholders
	* 	Release quality issues (8-9 out of 10 releases having problems) indicating systemic problems
	* 	Team distribution across time zones creating additional coordination challenges
## Action Items
	1.	Immediate
	* 	Document complete requirements for PNC January 15th release
	* 	Establish clear prioritization framework
	* 	Implement faster response protocols
	2.	Short-term
	* 	Review and restructure release management process
	* 	Address QA backlog and expertise gaps
	* 	Streamline communication channels
## Progress Analysis
**Theme Development**
	* 	Project Management Effectiveness: Declining
	* 	Team Stability: Critical concern
	* 	Communication: Significant barriers
	* 	Quality Control: Systematic issues
**Historical Context**
	* 	Recent leadership changes impacting stability
	* 	Loss of key roles affecting critical functions
	* 	Accumulating technical debt and quality issues
**Confidence Assessment**
	* 	Interpretation confidence: High
	* 	Context reliability: High
	* 	Pattern certainty: High
**Enhanced Summary**
The journal entry reveals a deeply troubled organizational structure with multiple systemic issues. The combination of high turnover, poor communication, and ineffective project management has created a situation where the team is spread too thin and unable to deliver effectively.
## Nova Analysis
**Key Historical Learnings**
	1.	"Communication breakdown is causing cascading failures across the organization"
	* 	Confidence: High
	* 	Reasoning: Multiple examples of delayed responses, misaligned communication preferences, and confusion about requirements demonstrate a systemic communication problem.
	2.	"Project management processes have deteriorated significantly"
	* 	Confidence: High
	* 	Reasoning: Concrete metrics showing 75% sprint carryover and 68 concurrent epics indicate severe process breakdown.
	3.	"Team instability is creating a knowledge retention crisis"
	* 	Confidence: High
	* 	Reasoning: Data shows 25 people churned in 12 months, including key roles, leading to lost institutional knowledge and disrupted workflows.
**Analysis Summary**
This entry marks a critical point in the organization's trajectory, revealing deep-rooted issues that have developed over time. The combination of high turnover, ineffective project management, and communication barriers has created a perfect storm of organizational dysfunction. The data-driven analysis, particularly from Jellyfish metrics, provides concrete evidence of these issues rather than just anecdotal concerns. The situation requires immediate intervention, particularly given the looming January 15th PNC release deadline and the current state of team capabilities.
The most concerning aspect is the apparent acceptance of these issues as normal operating conditions, as evidenced by responses from team members like Illia acknowledging these problems as ongoing challenges. This suggests a normalization of dysfunction that will require significant effort to address.

--==RAW NOTES==--
Getting stuff out of bookedby team has made me insane. Ivan can’t see forest for trees. Sees a small point, has to talk about that. Getting to Truth about what needs to be built is me pulling data and getting nowhere. Sean is “helping”, but he still has not sent me what he said he would and when I sent him a list to validate he did something else. Also, when Ivan still had not responded to my email about jellyfish, his answer was basically I don’t use email. 

All of this caused my head to explode today. Just anxiety and frustration. 

I also sent all my emails to illia, Sergey, and Ivan to start getting them on the same page (attached below). Sergey is on vacation. Illia responded late with a response below as well. 












My teams message
@Sergey @Ivan @Ilia
 
 
I want to share with you the analysis I've sent to Sean and Ivan over the past few days, and then explain why I'm bringing this specifically to you three.
 
 
First, here's what I sent to Sean regarding my initial observations:
 
 
<!-- Begin Sean Email --> Sean,
 
 
After reviewing the materials provided and interactions with the team over the past few days, I want to share my initial observations and proposed focus areas. While this is based on limited data and there may be existing processes I haven't yet seen, several patterns have emerged that concern me:
 
 
Immediate Concerns:
 
 
1. January 15th PNC Release Risk - No detailed requirements yet, only high-level features identified - 5 of 11 BookedBy developers have <6 months tenure - Senior engineers consumed with production issues - Two major features (Spanish localization, Uber-like checkout) already deemed unlikely - Infrastructure readiness unclear
 
 
2. Significant Team Instability - Lost 25 people in past 12 months including key roles:   * Two Principal Product Managers (both hired/left in 2024)   * Security Compliance Manager (5-month tenure)   * Principal Developer (4.5 years experience)   * Multiple senior engineers and QA
 
 
3. Current Team Composition Issues - BookedBy leadership all new (SDM 1 month, Principal PM 5 months) - QA team completely rebuilt (3 members <2 months) - Only 4 developers with >2 years tenure - ISO certification efforts stopped after Security Manager departure
 
 
4. Operational Concerns - 8-9 out of 10 releases having serious issues - Basic monitoring only, can't quickly identify user issues - Complex, tangled infrastructure - No clear release management process
 
 
The current response time (consistently 6-24 hours for basic information requests) is particularly concerning. In a critical delivery period, we need minutes/hours, not days, for basic communication and information sharing.
 
 
Proposed Focus (Pre-Start/First 30 Days):
 
 
Before November 18th: 1. Understand existing PGG requirements documentation and process 2. Review current release management practices 3. Get access to existing systems/monitoring 4. Meet with key stakeholders to understand current processes
 
 
First 30 Days: 1. Release Management - Assess current release processes and controls - Review/enhance quality criteria if needed - Understand and potentially strengthen incident response - Evaluate current monitoring and identify gaps
 
 
2. Team Organization - Map current roles and responsibilities - Review existing communication patterns - Document current escalation paths - Identify areas needing enhanced coordination
 
 
3. January Delivery - Work with team to assess current capability - Review existing risk mitigation plans - Align on stakeholder communication approach - Identify areas needing immediate support
 
 
My goal is to first understand what's working well and where we can provide immediate support to strengthen our delivery capability. While some processes may already exist, the January deadline requires us to quickly identify and address any gaps.
 
 
Regarding my planned Japan trip in December - given the situation, I believe I should cancel. The January deadline leaves no room for a week away during critical preparation time.
 
 
I'd like to discuss this assessment in our meeting today. Specifically: 1. Are these observations aligned with your view of the situation? 2. Are there aspects I'm missing or misunderstanding? 3. Do you have different priorities or concerns you'd like me to focus on? 4. Are there existing processes or capabilities I haven't yet seen?
 
 
While based on limited data, the patterns suggest we need to quickly understand and potentially enhance our operational readiness for January. I want to ensure my focus aligns with your vision and priorities.
 
 
<!-- End Sean Email -->
 
 
 
Then, after getting access to Jellyfish data, I sent this analysis to Ivan:
 
 
 
<!-- Begin Ivan Email -->  I just got off a meeting where they showed me the instance they pulled up with our data. While it will have to be fully configured with people that know more about specifics on how things are setup in JIRA now, and it will also need JIRA to be cleaned up as it is clear there are 100 different ways we have used JIRA/still use JIRA/sort of use JIRA, this gives us a pretty good overview.
 
 
 
I wanted to share this with you to get your thoughts before anyone else and get your thoughts. I am sure some of the details are wrong (number of devs, who is a dev, etc), the data seems consistently right with what I know now, but I am not in it you are. What are your thoughts?
 
 
Attached is a series of interesting screenshots I made along the way and some initial analysis.
 
 
 
Critical Red Flags 1. Historic Team Churn
 
 
* 673 inactive Jira users vs 21 current developers
 
 
* 25 people churned in just the last 12 months
 
 
* This level of turnover is extremely concerning and far above industry norms
 
 
2. Sprint Carryover Crisis
 
 
* ~75% of work is carried over between sprints
 
 
* Teams are essentially not completing sprints, just rolling work forward
 
 
* This indicates fundamental breakdown in planning and execution
 
 
3. Extreme Work Dispersion
 
 
* 68 concurrent epics in a 4-week period
 
 
* Only 3 epics receiving >5% team capacity
 
 
* Teams are spread so thin that meaningful progress is nearly impossible
 
 
4. Priority Inflation
 
 
* 12 epics marked as "major" or "critical"
 
 
* When everything is high priority, nothing is high priority
 
 
* Clear sign of ineffective prioritization
 
 
🟡 Concerning Patterns
 
 
1. Team Distribution
 
 
* Engineers spread across multiple continents/time zones
 
 
* No clear concentration of team members
 
 
* 34% of developers scattered across different locations
 
 
* This level of distribution without clear hubs is unusually challenging
 
 
2. Resource Allocation
 
 
* Highest allocation to any single initiative is only 10%
 
 
* Most work getting 3-4% of team capacity
 
 
* At these allocation levels, even simple projects would take months to complete
 
 
3. Cycle Time Degradation
 
 
* 52.9% increase in cycle time
 
 
* This trend suggests decreasing efficiency in delivery
 
 
The sprint carryover rate and work dispersion are particularly alarming - these numbers suggest a team that's constantly context-switching and rarely finishing anything. Combined with the historic churn numbers, this paints a picture of an organization that's struggling to maintain consistent forward progress.
 
 
These metrics are well outside typical ranges for healthy engineering organizations and suggest fundamental structural issues in how work is planned and executed.
 
 
<!-- End Ivan Email -->
 
 
 
Ivan provided some important context about JIRA Service Desk users and sub-team structure, which helps explain some of the numbers. However, the fundamental issues remain concerning.
 
 
Why am I sharing this with you three specifically? Sean has identified you as key people he trusts to get things done. I need your help either validating or correcting my understanding, and then helping drive urgent improvements.
 
 
I believe we need immediate focus on four critical areas: 1. PPG January 15th Release: We need complete requirements documented and sized ASAP. I've been trying to get clarity for over a week with limited success. We need to understand the full scope to set realistic expectations with the business.
 
 
2. Response Times & Urgency: Everything seems to take 6-24 hours for responses. While some attribute this to Teams vs Email usage, the reality is we need faster alignment and decision-making, especially given our distributed nature.
 
 
3. Release Quality: With 8-9 out of 10 releases having serious issues, we need to understand root causes. We can't move fast if everything we ship is breaking.
 
 
4. Work Focus: 75% sprint carryover and 68 concurrent epics suggest we're spread too thin. We need ruthless prioritization.
 
 
My current assessment: A lot of people, doing very little, with unclear priorities, and no urgency.
 
 
I want you to tell me if I'm wrong. I WANT to be wrong. But if I'm right, we need to start addressing these issues immediately, not wait until I officially start.
 
 
I'm setting up this channel for quick communication between us four. Can we start with your thoughts on: 1. Is my assessment accurate? 2. What critical context am I missing?
 
 
After we get to agreement on 1 and 2, assuming I am right/mostly right then
 
 
3. How can we drive immediate improvement in these areas? But first, lets make sure the 4 of us are aligned on the problem.
 
 
Looking forward to your candid feedback.
 
 
 
Note: I am trying to send you the screenshots, but if I click the attach file it just spins. Teams is the worst piece of software. I will figure out how to get you guys these screenshots.

Illia response 

Hi! From my side I can say that I completely unaware about this PNC release. I do not know what and when should be done for it. On previous week I've done some really urgent tasks before Jada's demo related to PNC, but it was urgent things that was added in the middle of the sprint without introducing big picture.
 
I can point some issues that on my opinion lead to sprint carryover and delays for planned tasks. Chad Walters already mentioned all of them but I want to highlight them one more time:
* **Lack of QA and QA expertise.** There was a period of time when BB team had no QA at all. During this period of time team accumulated a lot of tasks which was in 'Ready for QA'  state but we had no one to do QA. So all those task were migrating form sprint to sprint. Right now this issue not super relevant because now we do have QA in our team but still they need time to adjust and finish with all the 'Ready for QA' backlog.  
* **Changes in priority.** I think this is the most crutial issue. It is common thing when we have new super urgent tasks in the middle of the sprint which we need to take right away which is leading to delay in our planned tasks. Switching context affects the time needed to finish the tasks.  
* **Everything is urgent/blocker**. This point relates to the previous one. While working on some urgent task we can receive another more urgent task but previous one still is urgent


Ivan’s responses

One of the interesting ones is how bugs / production maintenance get added to sprints and how much they contribute to the carryover picture. There was an attempt to drive more focus towards new features by setting the estimates of bugs from production to 0 (to avoid giving "credit" for spending lots of time in a sprint on bugs); it's hard to say if it helped in any way or was harmful or had no effect, but if you combine that, with not really tracking how much time we spend on such issues, with little tracking and attention to velocity numbers, you can get lots of such items added to a sprint without any actual expectation of working on them.
